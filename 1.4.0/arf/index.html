<h1 id="european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-context">1.1 Context</h3>
<p>On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation
(<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.210.01.0051.01.ENG">COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2021/946 of 3 June 2021 on a common Union Toolbox for a coordinated approach towards a European Digital Identity Framework</a>, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2021%3A210%3AFULL">OJ L 210/51, 14.6.2021</a>) calling on Member
States to work towards the development of a Toolbox including a
technical Architecture and Reference Framework (hereinafter the ARF), a
set of common standards and technical specifications and a set of common
guidelines and best practices.</p>
<p>The Recommendation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis
for the implementation of the proposal for a European Digital Identity
Framework, without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering
with, or prejudging the legislative process.</p>
<p>The Recommendation sets up a structured process of cooperation between
Member States, the Commission and, where relevant, private sector
operators, to develop the Toolbox. The eIDAS Expert Group is tasked as
main interlocutor for the purposes of implementing this Recommendation.
The Expert Group\'s page can be found <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert%20groups/consult?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&amp;groupID=3032">at the official
page</a>.</p>
<p>The eIDAS Expert Group has since further developed the concepts and
specifications for the European Digital Identity Framework. The current
ARF version 1.4.0 is based on the legal text adopted by the
co-legislators.</p>
<h3 id="12-purpose-of-this-document">1.2 Purpose of this document</h3>
<p>The purpose of this version of the document is to establish high level
requirements as reference to create uniform conditions for the
implementation of the legislative act and to define the technical
specifications, standards and procedures that the Commission shall
develop for the purpose of implementing the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj">eIDAS Regulation</a>, and which
are related to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EUDIW core functionalities (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1347-1-1">art. 5a</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EUDIW relying parties (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1776-1-1">art. 5b</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements for QEAA (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e3849-1-1">art.45d</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification of attributes against authentic sources (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e3883-1-1">art.45e</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements for EAA issued by/on behalf of a public sector body
    (PSB) (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e3902-1-1">art.45f</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross border identity matching (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e2220-1-1">art.11a</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification of the EUDIW (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">art. 5c</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publication of a list of certified EUDIW (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1938-1-1">art. 5d</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security breach of the EUDIW (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e2020-1-1">art. 5e</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements for EAA issued by/on behalf of a PSB - notification
    (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e3902-1-1">art.45f</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission intends to use this ARF to develop the EUDI Wallet
Solution reference implementation.</p>
<p>The document presents a state-of-play of ongoing work of the eIDAS
Expert Group and does not imply any formal agreement regarding its
content. This document will be complemented and updated over time
through the process of establishing the toolbox, as described in <a href="#8-document-development">Chapter
8</a>.</p>
<p>While the main document is descriptive, two of the six annexes are intended as reference
for the technical specification and standards. The latter are the
annexes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The high-level requirements</strong>: This annex specifies the
    requirements for PID Providers, (Q)EAA Providers, PuB-EAA Providers,
    EUDI Wallet Providers, Relying Parties and other actors in the EUDI
    Wallet ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="13-guidance-for-the-large-scale-pilots-lsp">1.3 Guidance for the Large-Scale Pilots (LSP)</h3>
<p>To support the development of a reference implementation of EUDI Wallet
Solutions and to pilot its usage across different priority use cases,
the Commission launched a call for proposals on 22<sup>nd</sup> February 2022
under the Digital Europe Programme to pilot use cases for the EUDI
Wallet at a large-scale.</p>
<p>The objective of the Large-Scale Pilots (LSP) call is to support the
piloting of the EUDI Wallet around a range of use-cases involving both
public and private sector stakeholders. The LSPs will test the EUDI
Wallet in both national and cross-borders contexts and integrate with
the iterative development of the reference application.</p>
<p>The works of the LSPs will be aligned by the ARF, which will guide pilot
system design and architecture development together with the release of
the reference implementation.</p>
<p>The LSPs are expected to provide feedback on the ARF as they develop and
interact with Relying Party services, Qualified or non-qualified
Electronic Attestations of Attributes (Q)EAA Providers, Person
Identification Data (PID) Providers, Qualified and non-Qualified Trust
Service Providers and Users in meaningful interactions under the
proposed use cases.</p>
<h3 id="14-definitions">1.4 Definitions</h3>
<p>The definitions used in this document are added in Annex 1 of this
document. In Annex 1 there are two tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Table 1</strong> includes definitions cited from the eIDAS Regulation or
    from the eIDAS Regulation amendment proposal, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Table 2</strong> includes technical definitions that are used in the ARF.
    in some cases, these definitions originated in the context of
    specific topics. In these cases, the topic number appears in
    brackets following the definition, e.g., [Topic 11], to give it
    the relevant context. If the definition is related to two topics,
    both topic numbers will appear in the brackets, e.g., [Topic 33,
    Topic 34]. If the technical definition is generic, that is to the
    ARF as a whole or to more than 2 topics, no brackets will be added.
    If a definition relies on an external source such as a standard or a
    formal publication, the source is mentioned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15-scope">1.5 Scope</h3>
<p>This document only applies to the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. Attestations
that are not bound to or used by Wallet Instances are not included in
the scope of this document.</p>
<h2 id="2-use-cases">2 Use Cases</h2>
<p>The development of the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) is
strategically guided by use cases that showcase the user experience,
value proposition, and business requirements of the EUDI Wallet. In this
process, the eIDAS Expert Group initially creates service blueprints for
each use case. These blueprints meticulously detail the service
delivery\'s touchpoints, components, and processes. Their role is
twofold: they are instrumental in the service design and function as a
tool to improve user experience and service efficiency, while
simultaneously highlighting potential areas for enhancement. Serving as
a foundational element, these blueprints inform the creation of use case
rulebooks and the development of common specifications. Detailed in the
annexes, these blueprints offer comprehensive solutions with the
flexibility to incorporate alternative approaches and optional steps,
such as the discretionary display of pre-approved user data. It's
important to note that user journeys may differ depending on the chosen
implementation approach, affecting processes like data retrieval and
user consent.</p>
<p>The eIDAS Expert Group has described service blueprints for the
following use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identification and authentication to access online services, see
    <a href="#21-identification-and-authentication-to-access-online-services">Section 2.1</a> </p>

<p>Pseudonyms, see <a href="#24-pseudonyms">Section 2.4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several other use cases that will be detailed in subsequent versions
    of this document, see <a href="#25-other-use-cases">Section 2.5</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="21-identification-and-authentication-to-access-online-services">2.1 Identification and authentication to access online services</h3>
<p>The EUDI Wallet is primarily designed to facilitate secure user
identification and authentication at a high Level of Assurance (LoA) for
various online services, both public and private. This capability is
crucial, as it allows Relying Parties to confidently verify the identity
of Users they interact with.</p>
<p>In this specific use case, a User employs the EUDI Wallet to
authenticate with their identity accessing online services by using
high-security authentication. This process involves the use of multiple
identity verification methods. The User is particularly mindful of the
privacy and security concerns associated with sharing person
identification data (PID) online. Their primary goals include reliably
identifying themselves to services that demand user identification while
maintaining control over the sharing of their personal data.</p>
<p>This scenario covers the complete lifecycle of the EUDI Wallet from the
User\'s perspective. It spans from acquiring a valid Wallet Instance to
the process of identifying and authenticating themselves for an online
service. The focus here is on a practical remote same-device flow (as
detailed in <a href="#422-attestation-presentation-flows">Section 4.2.2</a> and <a href="#423-mobile-apps-and-web-browsers">4.2.3</a>). In this context, a User utilises a
single device for both securing their session and accessing the service,
ensuring a streamlined and secure experience.</p>
<p>Details on PID issuance requirements, the PID attribute schema, and the
Trust Infrastructure are further elaborated in the respective chapters -
specifically <a href="#3-ecosystem">Chapter 3</a> - Ecosystem, <a href="#5-attestations">Chapter 5</a> - Attestations and 
<a href="#6-trust-model">Chapter 6</a> - Trust Model, <a href="../annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/">Annex 2</a> (High level requirements in [Topic 2],
[Topic 10] and [Topic 23], and <a href="../annexes/annex-3/annex-3.01-pid-rulebook/">Annex 3.1</a> - PID Rulebook.</p>
<h3 id="22-qualified-electronic-signature">2.2 Qualified electronic signature</h3>
<p>The EUDI Wallet shall enable users to create qualified electronic
signatures or seals. This goal can be reached by using the
authentication and signature / seal capabilities of the EUDI Wallet as a
part of a local QSCD, or a remote QSCD managed by a QTSP [Topic16] and
[Topic 37].</p>
<h3 id="23-mobile-driving-licence">2.3 Mobile Driving Licence</h3>
<p>A significant use case for the EUDI Wallet involves allowing Users to
acquire, store, and present a mobile Driving Licence (mDL) as an
attestation to prove their driving privileges. In this use case, the
User employs an EUDI Wallet to present a mDL to a Relying Party (e.g.,
the Traffic Police).</p>
<p>The use case description concentrates on proximity supervised and
unsupervised flows, which involve scenarios where the User is physically
near a Relying Party, and the mDL attribute exchange and disclosure
occurs using proximity technologies (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth). The two
proximity flows have one significant difference: in the supervised flow,
the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a human Relying Party or
under their supervision (who may also use a device); whereas in the
unsupervised flow, the EUDI Wallet presents mDL attributes to a machine
without human oversight.</p>
<p>(Q)EAA issuance requirements, mDL attribute schema and Trust
Infrastructure details are further detailed specifically in <a href="#3-ecosystem">Chapter 3</a> -
Ecosystem, <a href="#5-attestations">Chapter 5</a> - Attestations, and in <a href="../annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/">Annex 2</a> - [Topic 2],
[Topic 3], [Topic 10] and [Topic 23].</p>
<h3 id="24-pseudonyms">2.4 Pseudonyms</h3>
<p>The present use case specifies a single type of pseudonym, issued by a
Pseudonym Provider, to a User having a Wallet Instance. There are
several types of entities that may provide a pseudonym to a User; for
example, a PID Provider or a QTSP.</p>
<p>The pseudonym in this use case is not designed to fit all possible use
cases and to comply with all possible requirements. Rather, it is
intended for basic use case, namely allowing a Relying Party to
recognise a User as someone about whom the Relying Party already knows
something, or with whom the Relying Party has interacted before.</p>
<h3 id="25-other-use-cases">2.5 Other use cases</h3>
<h4 id="251-health">2.5.1 Health</h4>
<p>Easy access to health data is crucial in both national and cross-border
contexts. An EUDI Wallet Instance MAY enable access to patient summary,
ePrescriptions, etc.</p>
<h4 id="252-educational-credentials-and-professional-qualifications">2.5.2 Educational credentials and professional qualifications</h4>
<p>Providing documents for qualification recognition procedures can be
costly and time-consuming for Users, Relying Parties such as companies
and employers, and Attestation Providers such as education and training
providers or other academic institutions. For example, digital diploma
attestations could be presented cross-border in a verifiable, trusted,
and consumable format to another education or training institution or a
prospective employer. An EUDI Wallet Instance may be a repository for
educational digital credentials as Electronic Attestations of Attributes
and a means for exchanging them by a learner to relevant relying
parties.</p>
<h4 id="253-digital-finance">2.5.3 Digital Finance</h4>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Solutions can facilitate complying with strong customer
authentication requirements, using the strong User Authentication
capabilities described in <a href="#21-identification-and-authentication-to-access-online-services">Section 2.1</a>. In line with the Commission's
Retail Payments Strategy [RPS], the use case would be developed in
close coordination with Member States' advisory groups on retail
payments and the finance industry.</p>
<h4 id="254-digital-travel-credential">2.5.4 Digital Travel Credential</h4>
<p>Digital Travel Credential (DTC) Providers may issue DTCs to EUDI Wallets
in a supported format enabling Relying Parties to identify Users and
their travel, thus facilitating the travel experience and the User
journey in this dynamic sector.</p>
<h2 id="3-ecosystem">3. Ecosystem</h2>

<h3 id="31-users-of-eudi-wallet">3.1 Users of EUDI Wallet</h3>
<p>Users of EUDI Wallets use the EUDI Wallet Instance to receive, store and
present PID, QEAA, PuB-EAA, or EAA about themselves, including to prove
their identity. EUDI Wallet Instance Users can also create Qualified
Electronic Signatures and Seals (QES) and utilise wallet-to-wallet
interactions.</p>
<p>Who can be a User of an EUDI Wallet depends on national law. The use of
an EUDI Wallet by citizens is not mandatory under the legislative
proposal. However, each Member State shall provide at least one European
Digital Identity Wallet within 24 months after the entry into force of
the implementing acts referred to in the Regulation.</p>
<h3 id="32-eudi-wallet-providers">3.2 EUDI Wallet Providers</h3>
<p>EUDI Wallet Providers are Member States or organisations either mandated
or recognised by Member States making the EUDI Wallet available for end
Users. The terms and conditions of the mandate or recognition are for
each Member State to determine.</p>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Providers make available to a User, through an instance
of their EUDI Wallet Solution, a combination of several products and
Trust Services foreseen in the legal proposal, which give the User full
control over the use of their Person Identification Data (PID) and
Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA, PuB-EAA or EAA), and any
other personal data within their EUDI Wallet. From a technical
viewpoint, this may also imply guaranteeing a User sole control over
sensitive cryptographic material (e.g., private keys) related to their
PID and/or (Q)EAA, including the use cases for electronic identification
and creating a signature or seal. EUDI Wallet Providers provide Wallet
Trust Evidence (WTE) and Wallet Instance Attestation (WIA).</p>
<p>EUDI Wallet Providers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
requirements for EUDI Wallets.</p>
<h3 id="33-person-identification-data-pid-providers">3.3 Person Identification Data (PID) Providers</h3>
<p>PID Providers are trusted entities responsible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>verify the identity of the EUDI Wallet User in compliance with LoA
    high requirements,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>issue PID to the EUDI Wallet in a harmonised common format, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make available information for Relying Parties to verify the
    validity of the PID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms and conditions of these services are for each Member State to
determine.</p>
<p>PID Providers may e.g., be the same organisations that today issue
official identity documents, electronic identity means, EUDI Wallet
Providers etc. EUDI Wallet Providers may be the same organisations as
PID Providers. In case an organisation acts as both a PID Provider and a
Wallet Provider, it shall comply with all requirements for both PID
Providers and Wallet Providers.</p>
<h3 id="34-trusted-lists-registrar">3.4 Trusted Lists Registrar</h3>
<p>A Trusted List Registrar is a party responsible for maintaining,
managing, and publishing a Trusted List. Within the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem, Trusted Lists exist for the following entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wallet Providers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PID Providers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QEAA Providers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PuB-EAA Providers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access Certificate Authorities for</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relying Parties,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PID Providers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QEAA Providers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PuB-EAA Providers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These Trusted Lists are described in more detail in <a href="#622-wallet-provider-registration-and-notification">Section 6.2.2</a>, <a href="#632-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-registration-and-notification">6.3.2</a>
and <a href="#642-relying-party-registration">6.4.2</a>, as well as in [Topic 31]. Trusted Lists primarily contain
the trust anchors of the relevant entities. A trust anchor is a
combination of a public key and the identifier of the associated entity
and may be used to verify signatures or seals created by that entity.
For PuB-EAA Providers, the Trusted List will contain the trust anchor of
the QTSPs that sign the PuB-EAA Provider certificates.</p>
<p>Member States will provide Trusted Lists for PID Providers, QEAA
Providers and PuB-EAA Providers, in compliance with <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG#d1e2162-73-1">Article 22</a>. These
Trusted Lists may also include non-qualified EAA Providers, but this is
not mandatory. Alternatively, domain-specific trusted lists or
alternative solutions for managing the trust anchors may be provided for
EAA Providers. For instance, trustworthy mDL or DTC Providers are
determined by other legal frameworks than eIDAS and published
accordingly.</p>
<p>An entity's status as a trusted entity can be verified by checking
whether they are present on a Trusted List. Trusted List Providers need
to provide a registration service for the relevant entities. The terms
and conditions for entities to become registered are for each registrar
to determine unless specified elsewhere e.g., in sectoral rules.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to [Topic 27] and to [Topic 31].</p>
<h3 id="35-qualified-electronic-attestation-of-attributes-qeaa-providers">3.5 Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA) Providers</h3>
<p>Qualified EAAs are provided by Qualified Trust Service Providers
(QTSPs). The general Trust Framework for QTSPs apply also to QEAA, but
specific rules for this Trust Service need to be defined as well. QEAA
Providers maintain an interface for requesting and providing QEAAs,
including a mutual authentication interface with EUDI Wallets and
potentially an interface towards Authentic Sources to verify attributes.
QEAA Providers provide information on the location of the services that
can be used to enquire about the validity status of the QEAAs, without
having an ability to receive any information about the use of the
attestations. The terms and conditions of these services are for each
QTSP to determine, beyond what is specified in the eIDAS Regulation.</p>
<h3 id="36-public-body-authentic-source-electronic-attestation-of-attributes-pub-eaa-providers">3.6 Public Body Authentic Source Electronic Attestation of Attributes (PuB-EAA) Providers</h3>
<p>Public Body Authentic Source EAAs (PuB-EAAs) are issued by or on behalf
of a public body responsible for an authentic source. The requirements
from Authentic Sources on the issuance and operation of PuB-EAAs are
intended to enable to Relying Parties to recognise them as QEAA on the
legal level.</p>
<h3 id="37-non-qualified-electronic-attestation-of-attributes-eaa-providers">3.7 Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA) Providers</h3>
<p>EAAs can be provided by any Trust Service Provider. While they are
supervised under eIDAS, it can be assumed that other legal or
contractual frameworks than eIDAS mostly govern the rules for provision,
use and recognition of EAAs. Those other frameworks may cover policy
areas such as educational credentials, digital payments, although they
may also rely on Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes
Providers. For EAAs to be used, TSPs offer Users a way to request and
obtain EAA, meaning they need to technically comply with EUDI Wallet
interfaces specifications. Depending on the domain rules, EAA Providers
may provide validity information about EAAs, without having an ability
to receive any information about the use of the EAA. The terms and
conditions of issuing EAAs and related services are subject to sectoral
rules.</p>
<h3 id="38-qes-remote-creation-service-providers">3.8 QES Remote Creation Service Providers</h3>
<p>The EUDI Wallet will allow the User to create free-of-charge Qualified
Electronic Signatures over any data. This will also enhance the use of
the EUDI Wallet for signing, in a natural and convenient way. The
creation of Qualified Electronic Signature or Seal by means of the EUDI
Wallet can be reached by several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the EUDI Wallet itself is certified as a qualified signature/seal
    creation device (QSCD), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the EUDI Wallet implements secure authentication and electronic
    signature or an electronic seal invocation capability as a part of a
    local QSCD or a remote QSCD managed by a QTSP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In figure 1 the QESRC Service Provider can be the remote QSCD. As part
of the ecosystem, the use of common interfaces and protocols for
provisioning Qualified Electronic Signatures and Seals will create a
unified European market for QTSP offering remote signature services.
European citizens will be able to choose any QTSP without worrying about
technical interoperability between them and this will enhance
competition and create better QTSP services.</p>
<p>Besides Qualified Electronic Signatures and Seals, also Non-Qualified
Electronic Signatures or Seal Providers can exist. However,
Non-Qualified Electronic Signature/ Seal Providers are out of scope of
the ARF.</p>
<h3 id="39-authentic-sources">3.9 Authentic Sources</h3>
<p>Authentic Sources are the public or private repositories or systems
recognised or required by law containing attributes about natural and/
or legal persons. The Authentic Sources in scope of Article 45e are sources for, e.g. attributes on address,
age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, education
and training qualifications titles and licences, professional
qualifications titles and licences, public permits and licences,
financial and company data. Authentic Sources in scope of Article 45e are
required to provide interfaces to QEAA Providers to verify the
authenticity of the above attributes, either directly or via designated
intermediaries recognised at national level. Authentic Sources may also
issue PuB-EEAs themselves if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS
Regulation. In figure 1 this is indicated by the arrow 'provides qualified data'.</p>
<p>It is up to the Member States to define terms and conditions for the
provisioning of these Pub-EAAs, but according to the minimum
technical specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the
verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of
attributes.</p>
<h3 id="310-relying-parties">3.10 Relying Parties</h3>
<p>Relying Parties are natural or legal persons that rely upon an
electronic identification or a Trust Service. In the context of EUDI
Wallets, they request the necessary attributes contained within the PID
dataset, QEAA, Pub-EAA and EAA from EUDI Wallet Users to rely on the
EUDI Wallet, subject to the acceptance by the owner of the Wallet (User)
and within the limits of applicable legislation and rules. The reason
for reliance on the EUDI Wallet may be a legal requirement, a
contractual agreement, or their own decision. To rely on the EUDI Wallet
for the purpose of providing a service, Relying Parties need to inform
the Member State where they are established and their intention for
doing so. Relying Parties need to maintain an interface with the EUDI
Wallet to request attestations with mutual authentication. Relying
Parties are responsible for authenticating PIDs and (Q)EAAs.</p>
<h3 id="311-conformity-assessment-bodies-cab">3.11 Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB)</h3>
<p>Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB) are accredited public or private
bodies, accredited by a national accreditation body designated by Member
States according to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008R0765">Regulation 765/2008</a> Article 6c (3), as responsible
for carrying out assessments on which Member States will have to rely
before issuing an EUDI Wallet or providing the qualified status to a
Trust Service Provider.</p>
<p>The EUDI Wallets will need to be certified by CABs. QTSPs shall be
audited regularly by CABs.</p>
<p>The standards and schemes used by CABs to fulfil their tasks to certify
EUDI Wallets are specified further, specifically in <a href="#7-security-and-data-protection">Chapter 7</a> -
Certification.</p>
<h3 id="312-supervisory-bodies">3.12 Supervisory Bodies</h3>
<p>For the Regulation, the supervisory bodies are important to review and
ensure proper functioning of the Wallet Providers and other relevant
actors. Supervisory Bodies should be created and appointed in the Member
States. The Supervisory Bodies are to be notified to the Commission by
the Member States.</p>
<h3 id="313-device-manufacturers-and-related-subsystems-providers">3.13 Device Manufacturers and Related Subsystems Providers</h3>
<p>In the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, commercial actors such as device
manufacturers and related subsystems providers fulfil an important role
to enable the EUDI Wallet Solution to work smoothly and securely in the
hands of the User.</p>
<p>Hence, device manufacturers, and related subsystem providers need to
provide a platform on which where the EUDI Wallet Solution can be built.
Usability, security, stability and connectivity are key factors.</p>
<p>The components provided by device manufacturers and providers of related
subsystems may include, among others, hardware, operating systems,
secure cryptographic hardware, libraries, and app stores.</p>
<h3 id="314-qualified-and-non-qualified-electronic-attestation-of-attributes-schema-providers">3.14 Qualified and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Schema Providers</h3>
<p>(Q)EAA Schema Providers publish schemas and vocabularies describing
(Q)EAA structure and semantics. It may enable other entities such as
Relying Parties to discover and validate (Q)EAAs. The Commission sets
out the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures for
this purpose. Common schemas, including by sector- specific
organisations are critical for wide-spread adoption of (Q)EAAs.</p>
<h3 id="315-national-accreditation-bodies">3.15 National Accreditation Bodies</h3>
<p>National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32008R0765">Regulation (EC) No 765/2008</a>
are the bodies in Member States that perform accreditation with
authority derived from the Member State. NABs accredit CABs as
competent, independent, and supervised professional certification bodies
in charge of certifying products/services/processes against normative
document(s) establishing the requirements (e.g., legislations,
specifications, protection profiles). NABs monitor the CABs to which
they have issued an accreditation certificate.</p>
<h2 id="4-high-level-architecture">4 High level architecture</h2>
<p>This chapter provides a broad overview of a system\'s core components,
their interfaces, and the overall design principles. Figure 2 visually
clarifies these core components, the key entities within the Wallet high
level architecture, and how they communicate via the primary interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="41-design-principles">4.1 Design principles</h3>
<p>To effectively translate the European Digital Identity Regulation into a
user-friendly, privacy-focused, and secure technical architecture,
establishing design principles is crucial. These principles, rooted in
the regulatory framework and enriched by industry best practices, will
serve as fundamental guidelines. This approach ensures compliance with
requirements emphasizing user-centricity, privacy, security, and
cross-border interoperability. It demonstrates a commitment to both
regulatory alignment and excellence in the EUDI Wallet\'s design.</p>
<h4 id="411-user-centricity">4.1.1 User-centricity</h4>
<p>The EUDI Wallet prioritises user-centricity as a core design principle.
This means placing user needs and experience at the forefront of every
design decision. The wallet should be intuitive and easy to use, with
seamless integration into existing use cases. Users should have clear
control over their data and privacy, with transparent information about
what data is being shared and with whom. Additionally, the wallet should
be accessible and inclusive, catering to users with varying technical
backgrounds and abilities. By prioritizing user-centricity, the EUDI
Wallet fosters trust and encourages widespread adoption, ultimately
achieving its goal of empowering users with secure and convenient
digital identity management.</p>
<h4 id="412-interoperability">4.1.2 Interoperability</h4>
<p>The EUDI Wallet prioritises interoperability as a core design principle.
This ensures the wallet functions seamlessly across borders within the
EU. Users can travel freely and confidently utilise their digital
identity wallets for various services, from e-government platforms to
private online interactions. Interoperability fosters secure data
exchange through standardised protocols, allowing trusted entities to
verify credentials effortlessly. This not only simplifies the user
experience but also strengthens overall security within the system.
Moreover, interoperability prevents market fragmentation by creating a
level playing field for different digital identity solutions. It fosters
competition and collaboration, ultimately driving innovation in the
European digital identity landscape. By prioritizing interoperability,
the EUDI Wallet architecture lays the foundation for a trusted and
universally accepted digital identity ecosystem across the EU.</p>
<h4 id="413-privacy-by-design">4.1.3 Privacy by Design</h4>
<p>The EUDI wallet architecture embodies the principle of privacy by
design. This means that the protection of user data is a fundamental
pillar of the wallet\'s design. The principle of data minimisation
guides the collection of personal information, ensuring only what is
necessary is gathered. The wallet empowers users with granular control
over what data is shared and with whom. Transparency is built into the
system, with clear explanations of how data is used and protected. By
making privacy a cornerstone from the beginning, the EUDI wallet aims to
foster trust and protect the fundamental rights of its users.</p>
<h4 id="414-security-by-design">4.1.4 Security by Design</h4>
<p>The EUDI wallet architecture embraces the principle of security by
design. This means security considerations are woven into the very
fabric of the wallet\'s design. Throughout the design process, potential
vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated. Secure coding practices
are mandated, and the architecture itself minimises attack surfaces by
compartmentalizing sensitive data and access controls. By prioritizing
security from the outset, the EUDI wallet aims to be inherently
resistant to cyberattacks and data breaches, fostering trust and user
confidence in this digital identity system.</p>
<h3 id="42-reference-architecture">4.2 Reference Architecture</h3>
<p>Figure 2 below gives an overview of the architecture of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem and its components.</p>

<p>Figure 2: EUDI Wallet Solution reference architecture</p>
<p>The following components have been identified as the core components of
the EUDI Wallet Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>User device (UD)</strong>: A User device serves as the host for the
    Wallet Instance. For Wallet Instances used by a natural person, the
    User Device will typically be a mobile device. For Wallet Instances
    used by a legal person, the User device may for example be a cloud
    server. The minimum hardware and software requirements for the User
    device will be determined by the Wallet Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wallet Instance (WI)</strong>: The app or application installed on a User
    device, which is part of an EUDI Wallet Solution and belongs to and
    is controlled by a User. This component implements
    the core business logic and interfaces as depicted in figure 2. It
    directly interacts with the WSCA/WSCD to securely manage
    cryptographic assets and execute cryptographic functions, ensuring a
    high level of assurance for authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (WSCD):</strong> This is trusted
    hardware providing a secure environment and storage for
    cryptographic assets (such as keys) and for running the WSCA. This
    includes the keystore but also the environment where the
    security-critical functions are executed. The WSCD is tamper-proof
    and duplication-proof. One WSCD may be used by multiple Wallet
    Instances, e.g. in case of an HSM. The WSCD consists of two parts:
    the WSCD hardware covers the hardware issued by the WSCD vendor and
    the WSCD firmware covers security-related software, such as
    operating system and cryptographic libraries provided by the WSCD
    vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application (WSCA):</strong> This is the
    secure application running on and utilizing the WSCD. One WSCA is
    associated with at most one Wallet Instance, and manages assets,
    such as keys, for this specific Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wallet Provider backend (WP</strong>): The Wallet Provider backend offers
    Users support with their Wallet Instances, performs essential
    maintenance, and issues Wallet Trust Evidences and Wallet Instance
    Attestations through the Wallet Provider Interface (WPI).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="421-interfaces-and-protocols">4.2.1 Interfaces and protocols</h4>
<p>The interfaces and their respective protocols, as discussed in this
section and illustrated in Figure 2, comply with the specifications
established by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1347-1-1">Article 5a</a>, paragraph 5, of the regulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Wallet Provider Interface (WPI)</strong> is used by the Wallet
    Instance to communicate with the Wallet Provider to issue the Wallet
    Trust Evidence and the Wallet Instance Attestation, as well as
    provide support to the user and collect metrics for accounting
    purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The User Interface (UI)</strong> is the point of interaction and
    communication between the User and the Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Presentation Interface (PI)</strong> empowers Relying Parties to
    securely request and receive the PID and various attestations (such
    as QEAAs, PuB-EAAs and EAAs) from EUDI Wallets, accommodating both
    remote and proximity interactions. For remote presentation flows, as
    detailed in the following section, the Wallet Instance implements
    the OpenID for Verifiable Presentation protocol [OpenId4VP]. In
    contrast, for the proximity presentation flow, it adheres to the
    [ISO/IEC 18013-5] standard. In a remote flow, when a Relying Party
    requires user authentication and data access to provide a service,
    the process initiates through either a web browser or a mobile app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Secure Cryptographic Interface (SCI)</strong> enables the Wallet
    Instance to communicate with the Wallet Secure Cryptographic
    Application (WSCA). This interface is specifically designed for
    managing cryptographic assets and executing cryptographic functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The PID Issuance Interface (PII)</strong> is based on the [OpenID4VCI]
    protocol and is used when the wallet instance communicates with a
    PID Provider to request and receive PIDs to be stored within the
    wallet instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Attestation Issuance Interfaces</strong> <strong>(AII)</strong> is based on the
    [OpenID4VCI] protocol and is used by the wallet instance to
    request various attestations that Users wants to include in their
    Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Remote Signing Interface (RSI)</strong> facilitates communication
    between the Wallet Instance and the Qualified Electronic Signature
    (QES) Remote Service Provider. This interface is specifically used
    to execute a QES remote signature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the "Deletion Request Interface" and the "Reporting Interface" as
mentioned in the Regulation are not depicted as <em>interface</em> in this
diagram. To be able to request as a User to delete personal data and to
request reporting, are seen as features of the Wallet Solution which are
required to be implemented in the solution.</p>
<h4 id="422-attestation-presentation-flows">4.2.2 Attestation presentation flows</h4>
<p>This section defines four distinct communication flows between a Wallet
Instance and a Relying Party, guiding the implementation of the
presentation interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proximity Supervised Flow</strong>: The EUDI Wallet User is physically
    near the Relying Party. Attestations are exchanged using near
    proximity technology (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth) between the Wallet
    Instance and the Relying Party Instance. Both devices may be with or
    without internet connectivity. A human representative of the Relying
    Party supervises the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proximity Unsupervised Flow</strong>: Like the supervised flow, but the
    EUDI Wallet presents verifiable attributes to a machine without
    human supervision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote Cross-Device Flow</strong>: The EUDI Wallet User views service
    information on a separate device from their EUDI Wallet, which is
    only used to secure the session (e.g., scanning a QR code on a login
    page with the EUDI Wallet to access online services).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote Same-Device Flow</strong>: The EUDI Wallet User uses their EUDI
    Wallet device to both secure the session and consume the digital
    service including information exchange.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific use cases integrate one or more of these flows. For detailed
user journeys across various use cases, please refer to the blueprints
in <a href="#annex-4">Annex 4</a> of the ARF.</p>
<h4 id="423-mobile-apps-and-web-browsers">4.2.3 Mobile Apps and Web Browsers</h4>
<p>This section examines the technical interaction between the Wallet
Solution, web browsers, and mobile apps, in regards of the flows
described in the previous section. This is necessary to implement the
attestation presentation interface effectively, with a focus on both
user experience and security.</p>
<p>When a Relying Party requires User authentication and some data to
provide a service, the process begins within either a web browser or a
mobile app. In the Remote Same-Device flow in particular, the User\'s
browser or app will redirect the request to their EUDI Wallet whenever a
service provider needs authentication or data. In contrast, a Remote
Cross-Device flow and both the proximity flows (supervised or
unsupervised), might start by activating the Wallet Instance through an
NFC tap or the scanning of a QR code, that will not require the
interaction with the web browser.</p>
<p>As illustrated in figure 2, secure and streamlined interaction with
other applications, both on the User\'s device and externally, is
crucial. Key areas for discussion and improvement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Cross-Device Flows</strong>: Existing cross-device flows need
    stronger security measures to combat phishing and relay attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relying Party Authentication</strong>: Before sharing attributes, the
    Wallet Instance must verify the Relying Party, and conversely, the
    Relying Party might authenticate the Wallet Instance. This can
    involve dynamic or static exchange of keys and metadata. Since the
    web browser or mobile app mediates communication between the Relying
    Party and Wallet Instance in the Remote Same-Device flow, it\'s
    crucial to define how this interaction works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wallet Selection and Invocation</strong>: In scenarios where users have
    multiple Wallet Solutions, the process of selecting and activating
    the appropriate Wallet Instance is critical for a seamless
    experience. Clear application interface between the Wallet Instance
    and the browser/app are also essential. Current approaches relying
    on custom URIs can introduce user experience friction and scaling
    issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="43-architecture-types">4.3 Architecture types</h3>
<p>Building upon the high-level design described in figure 2, at least four
different types of architecture for the EUDI Wallet Solution can be
identified, each leveraging a different type of Wallet Secure
Cryptographic Device (WSCD):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Remote Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (Remote WSCD)</em></strong>: In
    this architecture, the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device is
    situated remotely, separate from the user\'s device, for example -
    implemented by the Wallet Provider using an HSM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local External Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (Local External WSCD)</em></strong>: If a device lacks sufficiently secure hardware, such as a
    secure element, external hardware components like smartcards may be
    necessary to enhance security. This architecture involves an
    external Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device that is connected to, or
    interacts with, the User\'s device, to provide cryptographic
    functions, for example - a hardware token or smart card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (Local WSCD)</em></strong>: This
    architecture refers to a scenario where the Wallet Secure
    Cryptographic Device is integrated directly within the User\'s
    device. This includes solutions like eSIM/eUICC and eSE. In these
    scenarios, the WSCA (e.g., a Java Card applet) might be deployed by
    the Wallet Provider. Other examples are based on native solutions,
    such as StrongBox (Google) and SecureEnclave (Apple), in which access
    to the WSCD is facilitated via the operating system of the User
    device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Hybrid architecture</em></strong>: This architecture combines two or more of
    the previous three approaches.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="44-state-diagrams">4.4 State diagrams</h3>
<h4 id="441-introduction">4.4.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>In this chapter, state diagrams are presented to explain the relations
between the Wallet Solution the Wallet and the PID.</p>
<p>The following descriptions are not prescriptive of form factor, hence
depending on the implementation an EUDI Wallet Solution may consist of a
single mobile app, or a set of local and remote components available to
a specific User.</p>
<h4 id="442-wallet-solution">4.4.2 Wallet Solution</h4>
<p>An EUDI Wallet Solution has a state of its own, as defined by Article 5d
of the Regulation. The state of the Solution affects the state of all
EUDI Wallet Instances of that EUDI Wallet Solution. Figure 3 below shows
the states of the Wallet Solution:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3: State-chart of Wallet Solution" src="../media/image3.png" /></p>
<!-- <img src="media/image3.png" style="width:3.8190529308836396in;height:4.104166666666667n" /> -->

<p>Figure 3: State-chart of Wallet Solution</p>
<p>The <strong>Candidate</strong> state is the first state of an EUDI Wallet Solution.
This means it is fully implemented and the EUDI Wallet Provider requests
the solution to be certified as an EUDI Wallet as part of an EUDI Wallet
eID scheme.</p>
<p>If all the legal and technical criteria have been met, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the certification of the Wallet Solution by accredited and<br />
  designated CAB(s),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ex-ante supervisory activities by Member State supervisory bodies,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>both the body providing EUDI Wallets and the PID Providers have
  been published by the Commission (in accordance with Article 5d),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the information notified by Member States for publication of lists<br />
  of Wallets have been published in the Official Journal of the EU,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>then a Member State may decide to start providing Instances of the
Solution to Users. The state of the Solution becomes <strong>valid</strong>.</p>
<p>According to Article 5d, Member States inform the Commission of each
change in the certification status of their EUDI Wallet eID schemes and
the EUDI Wallet Solutions provided under that scheme. This means the
EUDI Wallet Solution can be officially launched, and Instances of the
Solution can be provided to Users.</p>
<p>Under the legal conditions in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e2020-1-1">Article 5e</a>, paragraph 1, the issuing
Member State can temporarily suspend an EUDI Wallet Solution. This would
for example be the result of a critical security issue on that EUDI
Wallet Solution. This leads to the <strong>suspended</strong> state. Under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1938-1-1">Article
5d</a>, paragraph 2, the issuing Member State can unsuspend the Wallet
Solution and continue issuance, bringing the Solution back to the
<strong>valid</strong> state. Under paragraph 1, the EUDI Wallet Solution can be
completely withdrawn.</p>
<h4 id="443-wallet-instance">4.4.3 Wallet Instance</h4>
<p>Figure 4 below shows the states of the Wallet Instance.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4: State-chart of Wallet Instance" src="../media/image4.png" /></p>
<!-- <img src="media/image4.png" style="width:4.5927395013123355in;height:4.538937007874016in" /> -->

<p>Figure 4: State-chart of Wallet Instance</p>
<p>An EUDI Wallet Instance lifecycle begins when the User installs a
component part of a valid EUDI Wallet Solution to their User device (see
<a href="#62-trust-throughout-a-wallet-solution-lifecycle">Section 6.2</a>; the Wallet Instance status is <strong>installed</strong>. Once an EUDI
Wallet Instance establishes communication with other components that are
part of the Wallet Solution, is activated, and is issued a Wallet Trust
Evidence (WTE) and a Wallet Instance Attestation (WIA) by an EUDI Wallet
Provider, it is in an <strong>operational</strong> state. In this state, the User
manages the EUDI Wallet Instance, which may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Provider updating the EUDI Wallet Instance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Provider revoking the EUDI Wallet Instance,
    including at the User\'s request. Revocation of the Wallet Instance
    is accomplished by revoking the Wallet Instance Attestation (see
    [Topic 9] and [Topic 38]).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User uninstalling the EUDI Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>operational</strong> state of the EUDI Wallet Instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The User can request issuance of a PID and optionally a QEAA, a
    PuB-EAA or an EAA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an EUDI Wallet Instance holds a valid PID set, it is considered
    <strong>valid</strong>. Note that this state cannot be verified or looked upon
    unless PID is requested. In this state, the User can use their EUDI
    Wallet Instance to present PID attributes. If the PID expires or is
    revoked, the EUDI Wallet is not automatically unusable, but rather
    its state is merely downgraded back to <strong>operational</strong>. This may
    affect the validity or usability of a QEAA, a PuB-EAA, an EAA or a
    QES certificate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes on Wallet Instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the above possibilities are independent from the possibility of a
    PID, QEAA, PuB-EAA, or EAA Provider, to revoke the attestations that
    they have issued to an EUDI Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The security provided by the Wallet Instance is relying on the
    Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device and its Wallet Secure
    Cryptographic Application. In the architecture overview (<a href="#61-overview">Section
    6.1</a>, figure 6) it is explained that multiple solutions are available
    for implementation, such as Remote Wallet Secure Cryptographic
    Device, Local External Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device, Local
    Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device and / or a Hybrid architecture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="444-person-identification-data-pid">4.4.4 Person Identification Data (PID)</h4>
<p>In the context of the EUDI Wallet, a PID begins its lifecycle when being
issued to a Wallet Instance. Please note that this means that the
management of attributes in the Authentic Source (adhering to national
structures and attribute definitions) is outside of the scope of the
ARF.</p>
<p>For certain use cases, the PID may be pre-provisioned, meaning it is not
yet valid when issued. In that case, its state is Issued, and it will
transition to Valid when it reaches the beginning of its validity
period. However, if the PID is issued on or after the validity start
date, its state directly changes to Valid.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 5: State-chart of PID" src="../media/image5.png" /></p>
<!-- <img src="media/image5.png" style="width:4.34150699912511in;height:4.624997812773404in" /> -->

<p>Figure 5: State-chart of PID</p>
<p>There are two possible transitions from a valid PID: it automatically
expires, by passage to the validity end date, or it is actively revoked
by its PID Provider. Expiration and revocation are essentially
independent transitions. Once a PID is expired or revoked, it cannot
transition back to <strong>valid</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="5-attestations">5 Attestations</h2>
<h3 id="51-introduction">5.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Within the European Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem, the Regulation
distinguishes four legal categories of attestations, which are defined
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Person Identification Data (PID)</strong>: A set of data that is issued
    in accordance with Union or national law and that enables the
    establishment of the identity of a natural or legal person, or of a
    natural person representing another natural person or a legal
    person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA)</strong>: An
    electronic attestation of attributes which is issued by a qualified
    trust service provider and meets the requirements laid down in Annex
    V of the Regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electronic attestation of attributes issued by or on behalf of a
    public sector body responsible for an authentic source (PuB-EAA)</strong>:
    An electronic attestation of attributes issued by a public sector
    body that is responsible for an authentic source or by a public
    sector body that is designated by the Member State to issue such
    attestations of attributes on behalf of the public sector bodies
    responsible for authentic sources in accordance with Article 45f and
    with Annex VII of the Regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Qualified EAA:</strong> An EAA which is not QEAA or PuB-EAA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the differences between these types of attestation are
purely legal. For example, a diploma may be a QEAA or a non-qualified
EAA, depending on whether it is issued by a qualified trust service
provider (QTSP) or by an unqualified one. Similarly, an mDL may be
issued as a PuB-EAA, a QEAA, or a non-qualified EAA, depending on the
legal status of the party issuing mobile driving licences in each Member
State, in addition to being an authorised mDL Provider in accordance
with the rules applicable for mDL Providers.</p>
<h3 id="52-available-standardised-formats">5.2 Available standardised formats</h3>
<p>All attestations can be described to have the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Attribute schema</strong> defines the structure, logical organisation,
    type and namespace(s) of the attested attributes as well as
    additional information such as information about the attestation,
    its issuer, the verification mechanisms, the underlying identity
    assurance, the Trust Framework to which the properties are related,
    and the proof of possession by the legitimate User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data formats</strong> define the way data in an attestation is formatted,
    e.g. its character sets, encoding and serialisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proof mechanisms</strong> define the methods used to secure the
    attestations for integrity and authenticity, including for selective
    disclosure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are only a few suitable standardised formats for releasing
electronic attestations of attributes currently available. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 defines an attribute schema, data format and proof
    mechanisms for mDL-s, which can be used also with other attribute
    schemas, see [ISO/IEC 18013-5].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selective Disclosure for JWTs (SD-JWT) defines a proof mechanism
    similar to [ISO/IEC 18013-5], but for a different data format, see
    [SD-JWT].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1 [W3C VC DM v1.1]
    defines a generic attribute schema agnostic to data formats and
    proof mechanisms, while v 2.0 introduces requirements on format and
    recommendations on proof mechanisms, see [W3C VC DM v2.0].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC) define a generic
    attribute schema and establish requirements on data format and proof
    mechanisms, see [SD-JWT-VC].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[Topic 12] presents the current and foreseen status of these technical
specifications and states the requirements regarding support for these
specifications by attestations.</p>
<h3 id="53-attestation-rulebooks">5.3 Attestation Rulebooks</h3>
<p>Since version 1.2.0 of this ARF document, the concept of an Attestation
Rulebook has been introduced. For each type of attestation, such as PID,
a pseudonym, an mDL, a diploma, an e-prescription, and so on, an
Attestation Rulebook specifies the attribute schema, data format and
proof mechanisms of that attestation, and, when required, the trust
mechanisms for authentication and authorisation. Each attestation has an
attestation type and namespace(s) it uses. The namespace(s) used by an
attestation define the identifier, syntax, and semantics of all
attributes that can be part of that attestation.</p>
<p>An Attestation Rulebook also makes some choices regarding the
protocol(s) for presentation that must be supported by the relevant
attestations. [Topic 12] contains the requirements for Attestation
Rulebooks.</p>
<p>Attestation Rulebooks are defined by different organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some rulebooks already have been defined by the European Commission,
    in consultation with the eIDAS Expert Group. This concerns the PID
    Rulebook, the mDL Rulebook and the Pseudonym Rulebook. These can be
    found in <a href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rulebook for an attestation intended to be used across
    organisations and/or across borders can be defined by an
    organisation in which, insofar possible, all stakeholders are
    represented. This will prevent multiple attestation rulebooks being
    defined for the same type of attestation, for example, diplomas. It
    will also prevent unnecessary differences in the syntax and
    semantics between similar attestations. The decision on which
    organisation will be responsible for a given attestation rulebook is
    out of scope for this document. As explained in [Topic 12], it is
    possible that an individual attestation provider needs to include
    attributes in an attestation that have not been specified in the
    relevant sectoral or EU-wide namespace. An example of this are
    attributes that only have a meaning within the Member State in which
    the attestation provider resides. To allow such domestic attributes,
    an attestation provider can define a custom namespace to specify
    attributes that are specific to this provider and are not included
    in the EU-wide or sectoral namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rulebook for an attestation intended to be used only within an
    organisation, will be defined by that organisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="54-catalogues">5.4 Catalogues</h3>
<p>Section 2 in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e3883-1-1">Article 45e</a> of the regulation, sets up the direct legal
basis for the Commission to \"<strong>where necessary, establish
specifications and procedures</strong> for the catalogue of attributes and
schemes for the attestation of attributes and verification procedures
for qualified electronic attestations of attributes\".</p>
<p>One of the main rationales for the ARF is to reach a high level of
interoperability. This interoperability should be achieved on different
layers. On the technical level, interoperability can be achieved by
using common standards, protocols and technical specifications, ensuring
common language for attestation Providers, Wallet Providers and Relying
Parties, enabling issuance, presentation and processing of the data
involved, based on agreed common protocols interfaces and syntax.</p>
<p>The other layer is the semantic one and relates to semantic schemes of
attributes. The risk is that an uncontrolled manner of implementation
and usage, will create barriers to straight-forward approach and will
complicate the implementation thus making the ecosystem much more costly
to create and maintain, complex, and error-sensitive, affecting the
quality of the overall system.</p>
<p>To re-use the building blocks of attributes and attestations, the
concept of using catalogues was introduced. Creating and maintaining
controlled vocabulary, catalogue of attributes and attestation
rulebooks, is essential for the development and success of the EUDI
Wallet ecosystem, enabling shorter "time-to-market\" and efficient
implementation.</p>
<p>Building on the requirements of [Topic 12], having in mind both the
need for interoperability on the one hand and the varied nature of
attestations and organisations specifying those attestations on the
other hand, the following principals were defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attestation Rulebooks for QEAAs and PuB-EAAs used within the EUDI
    Wallet ecosystem may be registered and published in a publicly
    accessible catalogue. The Attestation Rulebook catalogue MAY also
    include Attestation Rulebooks for non-qualified EAAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Commission will take measures to establish and maintain the
    Attestation Rulebooks catalogue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Attestation Rulebooks catalogue will enable attestation
    Providers, Relying Parties and other actors in the EUDI Wallet
    ecosystem, to know which attestation types exist, and what are the
    identifiers, syntax and semantics of all attributes that are part of
    the attestation, that they may issue, request and receive from a
    Wallet Instance, according to their role in the ecosystem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the following points were emphasised, to facilitate creation,
updates and adoption:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registration in the attestation catalogue is not mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration in the attestation catalogue does not create any
    obligation or automatic acceptance by any third party, or
    automatically means cross-border recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Attestation Rulebooks catalogue can be in the same
    environment as the catalogue of attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation of these principals will be discussed further in detail.
The ambition is to use existing efforts and tools created by the Member
States, the Commission and cross-border organisations, to connect and
interact with the stakeholders, to utilise existing data assets for
updating them when needed and add new data sets to support new use cases
that will be implemented in the eco-system.</p>
<p>[Topic 25] and [Topic 26] (combined into one topic), present the
current and foreseen status of the catalogues, their creation,
distribution, discovery, management and maintenance, that will allow
simple update procedures, not burdening the process on the one hand,
while ensuring consistent and on-going mechanisms to keep the catalogues
updated and accessible to the relevant actors, both those that create
the content and those that use, consume and process the attributes and
the attestations, and - last but not least - for the general public.</p>

<h3 id="61-overview">6.1 Overview</h3>
<h4 id="611-scope">6.1.1 Scope</h4>
<p>The Trust Model presented in this chapter describes, for all
interactions between components of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, which
trust relationships are established between the interacting parties to
enable these interactions.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6 EUDI Wallet trust architecture" src="../media/image6.png" /></p>

<p>Figure 6: EUDI Wallet trust architecture</p>
<p>Figure 6 above shows the parties and components that are involved in the
trust architecture for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the center of this ecosystem is the <strong>EUDI Wallet Instance</strong>, shown
in the middle in blue. <a href="#65-trust-throughout-a-wallet-instance-lifecycle">Section 6.5</a> describes the interactions between
the Wallet Instance and other roles in the ecosystem in the lifecycle of
a Wallet Instance, namely installation, activation, management, and
de-installation.</p>
<p>A Wallet Instance is the application of a Wallet Solution installed in
the device of the User, which is provided by an <strong>EUDI Wallet
Provider</strong>. Within this Trust Model, the operational lifespans of both
the Wallet Solution and its corresponding Wallet Provider are the same.
As illustrated in Figure 6, the diagram positions the Wallet Provider
above the Wallet Instance and depicts the Wallet Provider Registrar
located in the lower right corner for each Member State. <a href="#62-trust-throughout-a-wallet-solution-lifecycle">Section 6.2</a>
elaborates on the interactions among these entities throughout the
lifecycle of a Wallet Solution and Wallet Provider, including processes
such as registration and potential scenarios of withdrawal or
suspension.</p>
<p>One of the main functions of the Wallet Instance is to handle the User's
PID(s) and attestations. The PID(s) are issued by <strong>PID Providers and
the attestations by Attestation Providers</strong>, shown to the left of the
Wallet Instance in Figure 1. Like Wallet Providers, PID Providers and
Attestation Providers are registered by a <strong>PID Provider Registrar or by
an Attestation Provider Registrar</strong> before they can interact with a
Wallet Instance, and before a Relying Party can verify the PID(s) or
attestation those Providers issue. As a consequence of the registration, a PID
Provider or an Attestation Provider receives an access certificate from
a <strong>PID Provider Access Certificate Authority (CA)</strong> or from an
<strong>Attestation Provider Access CA,</strong> accordingly. <a href="#63-trust-throughout-a-pid-provider-or-an-attestation-provider-lifecycle">Section 6.3</a> describes
interactions between these roles in the lifecycle of a PID Provider or
an Attestation Provider, namely registration, and possibly withdrawal
and suspension.</p>
<p>After receiving one or more PIDs or attestations, a Wallet Instance can
present User attributes from these attestations to <strong>Relying Parties</strong>.
On the right-hand side of the Wallet Instance, figure 6 shows the
Relying Parties. Relying Parties are registered by a <strong>Relying Party
Registrar</strong> in their Member State. As a result of the registration, a
Relying Party receives an access certificate from a <strong>Relying Party
Access CA</strong>. <a href="#64-trust-throughout-a-relying-party-lifecycle">Section 6.4</a> describes interactions between these roles in
the lifecycle of a Relying Party, namely registration, and possibly
de-registration.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="#66-trust-throughout-a-pid-or-an-attestation-lifecycle">Section 6.6</a> describes interactions in the lifecycle of a PID or
an attestation, namely issuance, presentation to a Relying Party or to
another Wallet Instance, management, and deletion.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This trust model is conceptual and may be implemented by Member
    States in different ways. For example, the different Trusted Lists
    may be implemented as a single list, provided that this list clearly
    indicates which trust anchors can be used for which purposes.
    Similarly, a Member State may decide to combine multiple Registrars
    and/or Certificate Authorities into a single entity, again provided
    that that entity maintains clear separations between its different
    roles and responsibilities. In some case, existing entities can
    probably be used to fulfil these roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This trust model does not presume a specific implementation. In
    particular, the use of term 'certificate' does not imply a specific
    format. Depending on implementation, it may be an X.509 certificate
    or another format specified in the context of any other trust
    framework. Similarly, a 'Certificate Authority' may be implemented
    as a 'classical' X509-based CA according to [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280">RFC5280</a>] and
    [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3647">RFC3647</a>], or as a trusted third party binding public keys to
    entities in any other trust framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This trust model is valid for both remote and proximity use cases.
    However, technical measures taken to ensure that the requirements on
    trust are fulfilled may differ between these two use cases.
    Moreover, the authentication and authorisation mechanisms will
    depend on the characteristics of the interacting parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this version of the ARF, the trust model does not yet include
    interactions needed to enable Users to create qualified electronic
    signatures or seals. Please refer to [Topic 16] and [Topic 37].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="612-authentication-and-authorisation">6.1.2 Authentication and authorisation</h4>
<p>Within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, many interactions take place between
parties in which one party requests another party to perform a task. For
example, a User may ask a PID Provider or an Attestation Provider to
provide a PID or an attestation to a Wallet Instance, or a Relying Party
may ask a User to present attributes from an attestation from its Wallet
Instance. To be able to comply with such requests, these parties need to
trust each other. This trust generally requires the existence of the
following two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The requestee is sure about the requester's identity, and
    optionally the requester is sure about the requestee's identity.
    This is referred to as (single-side or mutual) <em>authentication</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requestee is sure that the requester has the right to request
    the data or task requested. This is referred to as <em>authorisation</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="613-assumptions-on-trust">6.1.3 Assumptions on trust</h4>
<p>This document makes the following assumptions regarding the need for
trust in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For any party in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, there is a risk that it
    could be impersonated by an attacker. Therefore, when any
    interaction between two parties takes place, both parties need to be
    able to authenticate the other. Note that this assumption does not
    mean that mutual authentication always takes place; it just means
    that the possibility to do so exists if one party has a business
    need to authenticate the other party it is interacting with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases, there is a risk that a valid party in the EUDI Wallet
    ecosystem tries to perform actions that it is not allowed to do. In
    particular,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attestation Providers may try to issue attestations they are not
    allowed to issue. For example, an Attestation Provider that is
    not officially entitled by a Member State to issue PIDs or mDLs
    may nevertheless attempt to issue an attestation having the PID
    or mDL attestation type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relying Parties may try to request attributes from a Wallet
    Instance for which they have no lawful grounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relying Parties may try to violate a User\'s privacy by tracking the
    User by processing their data without lawful grounds. They can do
    so, as an example, by comparing without lawful grounds a signature,
    hash, or public key value present in an attestation that the User
    presents to them to similar values known to the Relying Party.
    Moreover, Relying Parties may collude with other Relying Parties to
    do so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="614-other-trust-relations">6.1.4 Other trust relations</h4>
<p>Besides the trust relationships described in this chapter, other trust
relations are established as well. For instance, Users, PID Providers
and Attestation Providers, and Relying Parties trust certification
bodies and Trusted List providers. This trust is primarily rooted in
authority and in procedural measures, such as public oversight,
published security and operational policies, and audits, rather than in
technical measures. To verify that parties are indeed interacting with a
trusted authority, standard technical measures suitable for the context
will need to be used.</p>
<h3 id="62-trust-throughout-a-wallet-solution-lifecycle">6.2 Trust throughout a Wallet Solution lifecycle</h3>
<h4 id="621-wallet-solution-lifecycle">6.2.1 Wallet Solution lifecycle</h4>
<p><a href="#442-wallet-solution">Section 4.4.2</a> presented the lifecycle of a Wallet Solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Provider responsible for the Wallet Solution is
    registered by a Registrar. As a result, the Wallet Solution enters
    the Valid state. This is discussed in <a href="#622-wallet-provider-registration-and-notification">Section 6.2.2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under specific conditions, a Registrar may decide to suspend or
    withdraw a registered Wallet Provider. This implies that the Wallet
    Provider is de-registered. This is discussed in <a href="#623-wallet-provider-suspension-or-withdrawal">Section 6.2.3</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="622-wallet-provider-registration-and-notification">6.2.2 Wallet Provider registration and notification</h4>
<p>Figure 6 depicts the Wallet Provider to the top of the EUDI Wallet
Instance. To the left and below of this, the figure also shows that a
Wallet Provider registers itself and its Wallet Solution with a Wallet
Provider Registrar in its Member State. Subsequently, the Member State
notifies the Wallet Provider to the European Commission.</p>
<p>The Wallet Solution provided by the Wallet Provider is certified by a
Notified Body. The certification process is described in <a href="#7-security-and-data-protection">chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p>If the registration and notification processes are successful, the trust
anchors of the Wallet Provider are included in a Wallet Provider Trusted
List. During issuance of a PID or an attestation, the PID Provider or
the Attestation Provider can use these trust anchors to verify the
authenticity of a Wallet Trust Evidence signed by the Wallet Provider,
so they can be sure they are dealing with an authentic Wallet Instance
from a trusted Wallet Provider. See <a href="#6632-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-relying-party-instance">Section 6.6.3.2</a> and [Topic 9].
Similarly, when the Wallet Instance presents a PID or an attestation to
a Relying Party, the Relying Party can use the Wallet Provider trust
anchors to verify the authenticity of a Wallet Instance Attestation
signed by the Wallet Provider; see <a href="#66310-relying-party-authenticates-the-wallet-instance-and-the-wallet-provider">Section 6.6.3.10</a> and [Topic 38].</p>
<p>More details on the Wallet Provider notification process can be found in
[Topic 31].</p>
<h4 id="623-wallet-provider-suspension-or-withdrawal">6.2.3 Wallet Provider suspension or withdrawal</h4>
<p>Under specific conditions, a Registrar may decide to suspend or withdraw
a Wallet Provider. This means the Wallet Provider is taken off from the
Wallet Provider Trusted List. The conditions for this will be specified
by each Registrar. As a result of de-registration, PID Providers,
Attestation Providers and Relying Parties will no longer trust the trust
anchors of the Wallet Provider and will therefore refuse to interact
with any Wallet Instance provided by that Wallet Provider.</p>

<p><a href="#444-person-identification-data-pid">Section 4.4.4</a> presented the lifecycle of a PID Provider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A PID Provider or an Attestation Provider is registered by a
    Registrar. This is discussed in <a href="#632-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-registration-and-notification">Section 6.3.2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under specific conditions, a Registrar may decide to suspend or
    withdraw a registered PID Provider or Attestation Provider. This is
    discussed in <a href="#633-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-suspension-or-withdrawal">Section 6.3.3</a>.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="632-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-registration-and-notification">6.3.2 PID Provider or Attestation Provider registration and notification</h4>
<h5 id="6321-introduction">6.3.2.1 Introduction</h5>
<p>Figure 6 depicts the PID Providers and Attestation Providers to the left
of the EUDI Wallet Instance. To the left and below of this, the figure
also shows that each PID Provider and Attestation Provider will register
itself with a PID Provider Registrar or an Attestation Provider
Registrar in its Member State. Subsequently, the Member State notifies
the PID Provider or Attestation Provider to the European Commission.</p>
<p>If the registration and notification processes are successful, mainly
two things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider receives an access
    certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust anchors of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider are
    included in a Trusted List.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two aspects are discussed in the next two subsections.</p>
<h5 id="6322-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-receives-an-access-certificate">6.3.2.2 PID Provider or Attestation Provider receives an access certificate</h5>
<p>A PID Provider Access Certificate Authority or Attestation Provider
Access Certificate Authority (CA) issues one or more access certificates
to the PID Provider or to the Attestation Provider. A PID Provider or an
Attestation Provider needs such a certificate to authenticate itself
towards a Wallet Instance when issuing a PID or an attestation to it, as
described in <a href="#6622-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider">Section 6.6.2.2</a>. A PID Provider access certificate
indicates that its subject is a PID Provider. Similarly, an Attestation
Provider access certificate indicates that its subject is a QEEA
Provider, a PuB-EAA Provider or a (non-qualified) EAA Provider.</p>
<p>Note that the access certificate does not contain information about the
authorization of the Provider to issue attestations of a specific type.
Authorization is dealt with in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For PID Providers, QEAA Providers, and Pub-EAA Providers, no
    authorization is necessary, since these kinds of Providers are
    legally trusted by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For EAA Providers, this is different. Without additional measures, a
    fraudulent EAA Provider may be technically able to issue types of
    QEAAs, PuB-EAAs or EAAs that it is not legally allowed to issue. To
    prevent this, the applicable Rulebook (see [Topic 12]) may define
    mechanisms allowing a Wallet Instance, during issuance of an EAA, to
    verify that the EAA Provider is authorised or registered to issue
    the type of EAA the Wallet Instance is requesting. The same
    mechanism may also be used by Relying Parties during presentation of
    an EAA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, each Registrar includes the CA in a PID Provider Access CA
Trusted List or Attestation Provider Access CA Trusted List. This
Trusted List contains at least the trust anchor(s) of the CA. A Wallet
Instance can use these trust anchors to verify the authenticity of a PID
Provider or an Attestation Provider access certificate during the
issuance of a PID or an attestation. For more information, see [Topic
31].</p>
<h5 id="6323-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-trust-anchors-are-included-in-a-trusted-list">6.3.2.3 PID Provider or Attestation Provider trust anchors are included in a Trusted List</h5>
<p>For a PID Provider, a QEAA Provider, or a PuB-EAA Provider, successful
registration and notification also means that the Provider and its trust
anchors are included in a Trusted List. This Trusted List contains at
least the trust anchor(s) of the PID Provider, QEAA Provider or PuB-EAA
Provider. Relying Parties can use these trust anchors to verify the
authenticity of PIDs, QEAAs, and PuB-EAAs they obtain from Wallet
Instances. As documented in [Topic 12], each PID, QEAA, or PuB-EAA,
contains the URL at which the relevant Trusted List can be obtained.</p>
<p>Non-qualified EAA Providers may be included in a Trusted List, although
this is not required. Alternatively, non-qualified EAA Providers may be
included in a Trusted List unrelated to the EUDI Wallet ecosystem but
specific to another domain with a domain-specific governance such as for
mDLs or other types of EAAs. This implies that if a Relying Party
requests a non-qualified EAA from a Wallet Instance, it must know how to
obtain the domain-specific trust anchor it needs to verify the signature
over that EAA. To help with this, [Topic 12] requires that
non-qualified EAAs contain the URL at which the relevant trust anchor
can be obtained. However, Relying Parties must ensure, in some
context-specific way, that these trust anchors can be trusted. The
applicable Rulebook (see [Topic 12]) may define mechanisms enabling
this.</p>
<p>More details on the PID Provider or Attestation Provider notification
process, as well as on the information registered and published in the
PID Provider Trusted List or Attestation Provider Trusted List, can be
found in [Topic 31].</p>
<h4 id="633-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-suspension-or-withdrawal">6.3.3 PID Provider or Attestation Provider suspension or withdrawal</h4>
<p>Under specific conditions, a Registrar may decide to suspend or withdraw
a registered PID Provider or Attestation Provider. The conditions for
this will be specified by each Registrar.</p>
<p>Suspension or withdrawal implies that the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider access certificates are revoked. As a result, the PID Provider
or Attestation Provider will no longer be able to issue PIDs or
attestations to Wallet Instances.</p>
<p>For PID Providers, QEAA Providers and PuB-EAA Providers, suspension or
withdrawal also implies that their trust anchors are taken off the
Trusted List. As a result, Relying Parties will no longer trust PIDs or
attestations issued by the suspended or withdrawn Provider. The
applicable Rulebook (see [Topic 12]) may define additional mechanisms
ensuring that Relying Parties will no longer trust the trust anchors of
EAA Providers that have been suspended or withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="64-trust-throughout-a-relying-party-lifecycle">6.4 Trust throughout a Relying Party lifecycle</h3>
<h4 id="641-relying-party-lifecycle">6.4.1 Relying Party lifecycle</h4>
<p>The lifecycle of a Relying Party is described in this paragraph:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Relying Party is registered by a Registrar in the Member State
    where it resides. Relying Party registration and the Relying Party
    Access CA Trusted List are discussed in <a href="#642-relying-party-registration">Section 6.4.2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under specific conditions, a Registrar may decide to de-register a
    registered Relying Party. This is discussed in <a href="#643-relying-party-de-registration">Section 6.4.3</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="642-relying-party-registration">6.4.2 Relying Party registration</h4>
<p>Figure 6 depicts the Relying Party to the right of the EUDI Wallet
Instance. To the right and below of this, the figure also shows that
each Relying Party will register itself with a Relying Party Registrar
in its Member State. If the registration process is successful, the
Registrar includes the Relying Party in its public registry.</p>
<p>As a result of successful registration, a Relying Party Access
Certificate Authority (CA) issues one or more access certificates to the
Relying Party. A Relying Party Instance needs such a certificate to
authenticate itself towards Wallet Instances when requesting the
presentation of attributes, as described in <a href="#6623-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-validates-the-eudi-wallet-instance">Section 6.6.3.2</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, each Registrar creates a Relying Party Access CA Trusted
List containing the trust anchor(s) of all associated Relying Party
CA(s). A Wallet Instance can use these trust anchors to verify the
authenticity of Relying Party Instance access certificates. The
Registrar signs and publishes the Relying Party Access CA Trusted List
and makes the URL of the Trusted List available to a common trust
infrastructure maintained by the Commission, the so-called List of
Trusted Lists. Using the common infrastructure, any party in the EUDI
Wallet ecosystem will be able to find all Trusted Lists in the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>More details on the Relying Party registration process can be found in
[Topic 27].</p>
<h4 id="643-relying-party-de-registration">6.4.3 Relying Party de-registration</h4>
<p>Under specific conditions, a Registrar may decide to de-register a
registered Relying Party. The conditions for this will be specified by
each Registrar.</p>
<p>De-registration involves revocation of all valid Relying Party Instance
certificates, such that the Relying Party is no longer able to interact
with Wallet Instances.</p>
<h3 id="65-trust-throughout-a-wallet-instance-lifecycle">6.5 Trust throughout a Wallet Instance lifecycle</h3>
<h4 id="651-wallet-instance-lifecycle">6.5.1 Wallet Instance lifecycle</h4>
<p>Section 4.4.3 above presented the lifecycle of a Wallet Instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Wallet instance is installed on a device by a User. The required
    trust relationships for installation are discussed in <a href="#652-wallet-instance-installation">Section 6.5.2</a>
    below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, the Wallet Instance is activated by the Wallet Provider and
    becomes operational. The goals and required trust relationships for
    activation are discussed in <a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once in the <strong>Operational</strong> or <strong>Valid</strong> state, the Wallet Instance
    is managed by the User and the Wallet Provider. This management
    includes at least revoking the Wallet Instance when necessary. This
    is discussed in <a href="#654-wallet-instance-management">Section 6.5.4</a>. Management will also include regular
    updates of the Wallet Instance to ensure its continued security and
    functionality. However, this is not further defined in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User may de-install the Wallet Instance; see <a href="#655-wallet-instance-de-installation">Section 6.5.5</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="652-wallet-instance-installation">6.5.2 Wallet Instance installation</h4>
<h5 id="6521-required-trust-relationships">6.5.2.1 Required trust relationships</h5>
<p>The lifecycle of a Wallet Instance starts when a User decides to install
an EUDI Wallet Instance on their device. A Wallet Solution is provided
to the User by a Wallet Provider.</p>
<p>When downloading and installing the Wallet Instance, the following trust
relationships are established:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The User verifies that the Wallet Instance (i.e., the application
    the User is installing) is genuine and authentic and does not
    contain any malware or other threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User verifies that they can obtain the PID(s) or attestation(s)
    they need in an instance of this EUDI Wallet Solution. If the
    relevant PID Provider or Attestation Provider does not support the
    Wallet Solution, the User would not be able to use the Wallet
    Instance for obtaining those PID(s) or attestation(s).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next two sections discuss these trust relationships.</p>
<h5 id="6522-user-verifies-wallet-solution">6.5.2.2 User verifies Wallet Solution</h5>
<p>To ensure that the User can trust the Wallet Solution, Wallet Providers
preferably make their certified Wallet Solutions available for
installation only via the official app store of the relevant operating
system (e.g., Android, iOS). This allows the operating system of the
device to perform relevant checks regarding the authenticity of the app.
It also allows Users to use the same well-known channel for obtaining a
Wallet Instance as they use for obtaining other apps. Finally, it
prevents the User must allow side-loading of apps, which can increase
the risk of installing malicious apps.</p>
<p>Note: The Regulation does not exclude the possibility that a Wallet
Instance may be installed on a non-mobile device, for example a server.
In general, verifying the authenticity of Wallet Solutions not intended
to be installed on a mobile device is the responsibility of the User.
This can be done, for example, by comparing the hash value of the
application downloaded by the User with the hash value published by the
Wallet Provider.</p>
<h5 id="6523-user-validates-that-wallet-solution-is-usable-with-relevant-attestations">6.5.2.3 User validates that Wallet Solution is usable with relevant attestations</h5>
<p>A User installs a Wallet Instance because they want to obtain and use
one or more PIDs and/or attestations. However, there is no requirement
for a PID Provider or an Attestation Provider to support all certified
Wallet Solutions in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. This means that the PID
Provider or an Attestation Provider are not obliged to issue a PID or an
attestation respectively to any certified Wallet Instance upon the
request of the User. Instead, they may decide to support only a single
Wallet Solution, or a limited number of Wallet Solutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, each PID Provider and Attestation Provider will publish a
list of Wallet Solutions that they support. This list could be
published, for example, on their respective website. A Wallet Provider
can also publish a list of PID Providers and Attestation Providers
supporting their Wallet Solution. This allows Users to know whether the
Wallet Instance they are about to install will support the PID and the
attestation(s) they wish to use.</p>
<h4 id="653-wallet-instance-activation">6.5.3 Wallet Instance activation</h4>
<p>After its installation, a new EUDI Wallet Instance will need to be
activated by the Wallet Provider. Activation has at least the following
purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Provider requests data about the User's device from
    the EUDI Wallet Instance. This data may include the communication
    technologies supported by the device and the characteristics of the
    WSCD(s) used by the device to securely store cryptographic keys and
    data associated with the EUDI Wallet Instance and the attestations
    in that Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Provider issues a Wallet Trust Evidence (WTE) to the
    Wallet Instance. The WTE is described in [Topic 9]. The WTE has
    two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It describes the capabilities and properties of the Wallet
    Instance, the User device and the WSCD(s). This allows a PID
    Provider or an Attestation Provider to verify that the Wallet
    Instance complies with the Provider's requirements and therefore
    is fit to receive a PID or an attestation from the Provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, the WTE contains a WTE public key. During the issuance
    of a PID or an attestation (see <a href="#6623-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-validates-the-eudi-wallet-instance">Section 6.6.2.3</a>), a PID Provider
    or Attestation Provider can use this public key to verify that
    the Wallet Instance is in possession of the corresponding
    private key. Moreover, at that time, the Wallet Instance will
    send another public key to the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider. The Provider will include this public key in the
    issued PID or attestation. By using a concept called public key
    association, described in [Topic 9], the PID Provider or
    Attestation Provider can verify that the private key belonging
    to this public key is protected by the same WSCD as the private
    key belonging to the WTE public key. Thus, the PID Provider or
    Attestation Provider can trust this new public key.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Provider issues a Wallet Instance Attestation (WIA) to
    the Wallet Instance. The WIA contains information allowing a PID
    Provider, an Attestation Provider, or a Relying Party, to verify
    that the Wallet Provider did not revoke the Wallet Instance
    Attestation (and hence the Wallet Instance itself). The WIA and the
    revocation mechanisms for Wallet Instances are described in [Topic
    38].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance requests the User to set up a User
    authentication mechanism. User authentication is necessary when (or
    before) the Wallet Instance asks the User for approval to present
    some attributes to a Relying Party, see <a href="#6634-wallet-instance-obtains-user-approval-for-presenting-attributes">Section 6.6.3.4</a>. User
    authentication can be done by the Wallet Instance itself or by the
    WSCD. The latter is required before the WSCD performs any operations
    with cryptographic keys belonging to the Wallet Instance or to a PID
    or to an attestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Provider sets up a user account for the User to ensure
    that the User can request the suspension or revocation of their
    Wallet Instance in case of theft or loss. The Wallet Provider
    associates the Wallet Instance with the new user account. The Wallet
    Provider registers one or more backend-based User authentication
    methods that the Wallet Provider will use to authenticate the User.
    Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Provider does not need to know any real-world
    attributes of the User. The User can use a pseudonym to
    register, for example - an e-mail address. If the Wallet
    Provider wants to request additional User attributes, for
    example - to be able to provide additional services, they are
    free to do so if the User consents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case, User details registered by the Wallet Provider will
    not be included in the WIA or the WTE. They are strictly for use
    by the Wallet Provider only.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For successful EUDI Wallet Instance activation, the following trust
relations are established:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Instance authenticates the EUDI Wallet Provider,
    meaning that the instance is sure that it is dealing with the
    genuine Wallet Provider who provided it to the User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Provider authenticates the EUDI Wallet Instance.
    This means that the EUDI Wallet Provider is sure that the instance
    is indeed a true instance of their EUDI Wallet Solution, and not a
    fake app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both trust relationships are the responsibility of the Wallet Provider.
The ARF does not specify how these trust relationships can be satisfied.</p>
<h4 id="654-wallet-instance-management">6.5.4 Wallet Instance management</h4>
<p>Starting from Wallet Instance activation and until it is de-installed by
the User, a Wallet Instance is managed by the User and the Wallet
Provider. The Wallet Provider is responsible at least to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>perform installation of a new version of the Wallet Solution as
    necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update the WIAs or the WTEs as necessary; see [Topic 9].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suspends or revokes the Wallet Instance in case its security is
    compromised; see [Topic 38].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The User will be able to request the Wallet Provider to suspend or
revoke the Wallet Instance at least in case of loss or theft of the
User's device. See [Topic 38].</p>
<p>In case the Wallet Instance contains a PID, the PID Provider may request
the Wallet Provider to revoke the Wallet Instance in case the natural
person using the Wallet Instance has died or the legal person using the
Wallet Instance has ceased operations. See [Topic 38].</p>
<p>Lastly, the Wallet Instance supports procedures for backing up and
restoring the attestations it contains, or for migrating these
attestations to a different Wallet Solution. See [Topic 33] and
[Topic 34] respectively.</p>
<p>To allow Wallet Instance management, the following trust relations are
established:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When contacting the Wallet Provider, the User authenticates the
    Wallet Provider. This means the User is sure that they are visiting
    the website or the user portal of the genuine Wallet Provider who is
    responsible for the User's Wallet Instance, and not a spoofed
    website or portal. This can be done, for instance, by using standard
    mechanisms such as TLS server authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When contacted by a User, the Wallet Provider authenticates the
    User. This means that the Wallet Provider is sure that the User is
    indeed the User that was associated with the Wallet Instance during
    activation. For this, the Wallet Provider uses the authentication
    methods established in the User's account during activation, see
    <a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Instance authenticates the EUDI Wallet Provider,
    meaning that the EUDI Wallet Instance is sure that it is dealing
    with the genuine EUDI Wallet Provider. This must be ensured by the
    Wallet Provider. The ARF does not specify how this trust
    relationship can be satisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EUDI Wallet Provider authenticates the EUDI Wallet Instance.
    This means that the EUDI Wallet Provider is sure that the EUDI
    Wallet Instance is indeed a true instance of their EUDI Wallet
    Solution, and not a fake app. This must be ensured by the Wallet
    Provider. The ARF does not specify how this trust relationship can
    be satisfied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically for the functionality allowing a PID Provider to request
Wallet Instance revocation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When contacted by a PID Provider, the Wallet Provider authenticates
    the PID Provider. <a href="#6622-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider">Section 6.6.2.2</a> below describes how a Wallet
    Instance can do this during PID issuance; a Wallet Provider can use
    the same mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To identify the Wallet Instance that is to be revoked, the PID
    Provider uses a Wallet Instance identifier provided by the Wallet
    Provider in the WTE during PID issuance; see [Topic 9].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="655-wallet-instance-de-installation">6.5.5 Wallet Instance de-installation</h4>
<p>No trust relationships are required for Wallet Instance de-installation;

Wallet Instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using their Wallet Instance, the User requests the issuance of a PID
    or an attestation from a PID Provider or an Attestation Provider.
    The required trust relationships for issuance are discussed in
    <a href="#662-pid-or-attestation-issuance">Section 6.6.2</a> below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the attestation is issued into the Wallet Instance, the User
    can then present attributes from this attestation to a Relying Party
    Instance, according to the User\'s decision and depending on
    successful authentication of the Relying Party. The required trust
    relationships for presenting PIDs and attestations, including User
    approval and Relying Party authentication, are discussed in <a href="#663-pid-or-attestation-presentation-to-relying-party">Section
    6.6.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of presenting attributes to a Relying Party, a User can also
    present them to another User, meaning the Wallet Instance is
    interacting with another Wallet Instance. This is briefly discussed
    in <a href="#664-pid-or-attestation-presentation-to-another-wallet-instance">Section 6.6.4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or the Attestation Provider respectively, remains
    responsible for managing the attestation over its lifetime.
    Management may include refreshing or changing the PID or the
    attestation. The Provider can also remove or revoke the PID or the
    attestation, possibly based on a request of the User. The required
    trust relationships for managing PIDs and attestations are discussed
    in <a href="#665-pid-or-attestation-management">Section 6.6.5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <a href="#666-pid-or-attestation-deletion">Section 6.6.6</a> discusses the scenario that a User decides to

<h4 id="662-pid-or-attestation-issuance">6.6.2 PID or attestation issuance</h4>
<h5 id="6621-required-trust-relationships">6.6.2.1 Required trust relationships</h5>
<p>The lifecycle of a PID or an attestation starts when a User, using their
Wallet Instance, requests a PID Provider or an Attestation Provider to
issue the PID or an attestation to their Wallet Instance. The following
trust relationships are established during issuance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance authenticates the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider using the certificate referred to in <a href="#63-trust-throughout-a-pid-provider-or-an-attestation-provider-lifecycle">Section 6.3</a>. This ensures that
    the User can trust that the PID or attestation they are about
    to receive, is issued by an authenticated PID Provider or
    Attestation Provider respectively. See <a href="#6622-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider">Section 6.6.2.2</a> below
    describing how this will be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider authenticates the User,
    meaning that the Provider is sure about the identity of the User.
    This is necessary to enable determination of the values of the
    attributes that the Provider will attest to. For instance, a PID
    Provider needs to authenticate the User to ensure it provides a PID
    containing the correct family name and date of birth. The method by
    which the PID Provider or Attestation Provider performs User
    identification and authentication is out of scope of the ARF, as
    these processes are specific to each PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider authenticates and validates
    the Wallet Instance, see <a href="#6623-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-validates-the-eudi-wallet-instance">Section 6.6.2.3</a> below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider verifies that the Wallet
    Provider did not revoke or suspend the Wallet Instance. This is
    described in <a href="#6624-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-verifies-that-wallet-instance-is-not-suspended-or-revoked">Section 6.6.2.4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, after the PID or attestation is issued to the Wallet
    Instance, the User may have to activate it before they can use it;
    see <a href="#6625-user-activates-the-pid-or-attestation">Section 6.6.2.5</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More detailed requirements for the issuance process of PIDs and
attestations, for instance regarding the issuance protocol, are included
in [Topic 10] and [Topic 23].</p>
<h5 id="6622-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider">6.6.2.2 Wallet Instance authenticates the PID Provider or Attestation Provider</h5>
<p>As shown in figure 6, a Wallet Instance downloads the PID Provider
Access CA Trusted List(s) and Attestation Provider Access CA Trusted
List(s) it needs from the relevant Registrar(s), possibly after having
located them via the Commission common trust infrastructure. See <a href="#632-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-registration-and-notification">Section
6.3.2</a> for more information on these Trusted Lists.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance downloads the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider <strong>Access CA</strong> Trusted Lists, not the PID Provider or
    Attestation Provider Trusted Lists. See <a href="#632-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-registration-and-notification">Section 6.3.2</a> for the
    difference between these lists. The Wallet Instance needs the Access
    CA Trusted Lists to authenticate the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider. The Wallet Instance does not need to verify the
    authenticity of the PID(s) or attestations issued by the PID
    Provider or Attestation Provider respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not mandatory for each Wallet Instance to possess all PID
    Provider and Attestation Provider CA Trusted Lists, if there are
    multiple. Wallet Providers will choose which Trusted Lists they need
    to subscribe to, for example depending on the Member State(s) they
    are operating in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the process of requesting a PID or an attestation, the User
directs the Wallet Instance to contact the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider. The User may for example use the Wallet Instance to scan a QR
code or tap an NFC tag to do so. Note that no centralised service
discovery mechanism for PID or attestation issuance is foreseen.</p>
<p>Before requesting the issuance of a PID or an attestation, the Wallet
Instance authenticates the PID Provider or the Attestation Provider. To
do so, the Wallet Instance verifies the certificate presented to it by
the PID Provider or Attestation Provider. The Wallet Instance checks
that the certificate indicates that its subject is indeed a PID Provider
or an Attestation Provider. The Wallet Instance also verifies that the
certificate is authentic, that it is valid at the time of validation,
and that the issuer of the certificate is a CA that is in the
Attestation Provider CA Trusted List.</p>
<p>After the Wallet Instance receives the PID or attestation from the
Provider, it verifies that the type of attestation it received matches
the request.</p>
<p>The Wallet Instance requests the User's approval before storing a PID or
an attestation. When requesting approval, the Wallet Instance shows the
contents of the PID or attestation to the User. The Wallet Instance also
informs the User about the identity of the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider, using the subject information from the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Verifies the authenticity of the Wallet Instance</strong></p>
<p>As shown in figure 6, a PID Provider or an Attestation Provider
downloads the Wallet Provider Trusted List(s) it needs from the relevant
Registrar(s), possibly after having located them via the Commission
common trust infrastructure.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not mandatory for PID Providers or Attestation Providers to
    possess all Wallet Provider Trusted Lists, if there are multiple.
    This is because it is not mandatory for a PID Provider or an
    Attestation Provider to accept all certified Wallet Solutions in the
    EUDI Wallet ecosystem. Each PID Provider or Attestation Provider
    will choose which Trusted Lists they need to subscribe to.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a> above described that a Wallet Provider, during activation
of a Wallet Instance, issues a Wallet Trust Evidence (WTE) to the Wallet
Instance. When the Wallet Instance sends a request for a PID or an
attestation to a PID Provider or to an Attestation Provider, it includes
the WTE in the request. The PID Provider or Attestation Provider
verifies the signature over the WTE, using the Wallet Provider trust
anchor obtained from the Trusted List. Next, the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider verifies that the Wallet Instance possesses the
private key belonging to the public key in the WTE. This proves that the
Wallet Instance is authentic and is provided by a trusted Wallet
Provider. For more details see [Topic 9].</p>
<p><strong>Optionally, verifies that the User's Wallet Instance supports all
required features</strong></p>
<p>The WTE describes relevant features of the Wallet Instance, as well as
the device it is installed on. Depending on their needs, PID Providers
or Attestation Providers optionally verify that the User's Wallet
Instance supports all features they require. For example, for some PID
Providers or Attestation Providers it may be relevant to know whether
the Wallet Instance supports presenting the attestation in proximity
flows using NFC.</p>
<p><strong>Optionally, validates the properties of the WSCD</strong></p>
<p>The WTE describes the certifications and the other relevant properties
of the WSCD, i.e., the secure cryptographic device used by the Wallet
Instance to store and manage cryptographic keys. The security level of
the WSCD is a key determinant for the overall Level of Assurance (LoA)
of the Wallet Instance. For obtaining a PID, the Wallet Instance and the
WSCD will need to comply with the requirements for LoA High. For other
attestations, LoA High or Substantial will be needed, depending on the
requirements of the Attestation Provider.</p>
<p><strong>Verifies that the PID key or the attestation key is protected by the
WSCD</strong></p>
<p>Knowing the properties of the WSCD is not very useful if the PID
Provider or Attestation Provider cannot be sure that the private key for
the PID or their new attestation is indeed protected by that WSCD.
[Topic 9] describes how the PID Provider or Attestation Provider can
obtain a so-called proof of association from the WSCD. This proof of
association proves that the WSCD described in the WTE protects both the
WTE public key and the public key of the PID or the new attestation.</p>

<p><a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a> above described that a Wallet Provider, during activation
of a Wallet Instance, issues a Wallet Instance Attestation (WIA) to the
Wallet Instance. The WIA allows PID Providers, Attestation Providers and
Relying Parties to verify that the Wallet Instance is not suspended or
revoked. [Topic 38] describes how this is done.</p>
<h5 id="6625-user-activates-the-pid-or-attestation">6.6.2.5 User activates the PID or attestation</h5>
<p>As documented in [Topic 9], to achieve Level of Assurance (LoA)
"high", <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R1502">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502</a> requires that
an activation process must be implemented to verify that the PID or
attestation was delivered only into the possession of the person to whom
it belongs. This can be done, for example, by entering a PIN code that
was sent by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider to the User 'out of
band', for example by means of a letter sent to their official postal
address.</p>
<h4 id="663-pid-or-attestation-presentation-to-relying-party">6.6.3 PID or attestation presentation to Relying Party</h4>
<h5 id="6631-required-trust-relationships">6.6.3.1 Required trust relationships</h5>
<p>A Relying Party can request a User to present some attributes from a PID
or from an attestation in their Wallet Instance. Figure 6 shows that a
Relying Party uses a Relying Party Instance to interact with the Wallet
Instance of the User. The relationship between the Relying Party and
their Relying Party Instance is equivalent to the relationship between
the User and their Wallet Instance.</p>
<p>When processing the request, the following trust relationships are
established:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance authenticates the Relying Party Instance,
    ensuring the User about the Relying Party's identity. <a href="#6632-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-relying-party-instance">Section
    6.6.3.2</a> explains how this will be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider, during issuance, may
    optionally have embedded a disclosure policy in the PID or
    attestation. If such a policy is present for the requested PID or
    attestation, the Wallet Instance evaluates the disclosure policy and
    informs the User about the outcome of this evaluation. See <a href="#6633-wallet-instance-evaluates-disclosure-policy-embedded-in-attestation-if-present">Section
    6.6.3.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User approves or rejects the presentation of the requested
    attributes, or some of them, for selective disclosure, possibly
    based on the outcome of the evaluation of the embedded disclosure
    policy. User approval is described in <a href="#6634-wallet-instance-obtains-user-approval-for-presenting-attributes">Section 6.6.3.4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Subsequently, after the Wallet Instance presents the selected attributes
from the PID or attestation to the Relying Party Instance by sending a
response to the request, the Relying Party validates the response. The
following trust relationships are established:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party Instance verifies the electronic signature or seal
    of the PID or attestation. This ensures that the Relying Party can
    trust that the PID or attestation it receives is issued by an
    authentic Provider and has not been changed. This is described in
    <a href="#6635-relying-party-instance-verifies-the-authenticity-of-the-pid-or-attestation">Section 6.6.3.5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party verifies that the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider did not revoke or suspend the PID or attestation. This is
    described in <a href="#6636-relying-party-verifies-that-the-pid-or-attestation-is-not-revoked">Section 6.6.3.6</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party verifies that the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider issued this attestation to the same Wallet Instance that
    provided it to the Relying Party. In other words, it checks that the
    attestation was not copied or replayed. This is generally called
    device binding, and it is discussed in <a href="#6637-relying-party-verifies-device-binding">Section 6.6.3.7</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some use cases, the Relying Party verifies that the person
    presenting the attestation is the User, meaning the subject of the
    PID or attestation. This is called User binding. <strong>I</strong>n other use
    cases, the Relying Party trusts that Wallet Instance and the WSCD
    have done this. User binding is discussed in <a href="#6638-relying-party-verifies-or-trusts-user-binding">Section 6.6.3.8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party can request attributes from two or more
    attestations in the same interaction. This is called a <strong>combined
    presentation of attributes</strong>. If so, the Relying Party verifies that
    these attestations belong to the same User. This is discussed in
    <a href="#6639-relying-party-verifies-combined-presentation-of-attributes">Section 6.6.3.9</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either before or after validating the PID or attestation per steps 4 -
8,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party Instance authenticates the Wallet Instance and the
    Wallet Provider; see <a href="#66310-relying-party-authenticates-the-wallet-instance-and-the-wallet-provider">Section 6.6.3.10</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party Instance verifies that the Wallet Provider did not
    suspend or revoke the Wallet Instance, see <a href="#66311-relying-party-verifies-that-wallet-instance-is-not-suspended-or-revoked">Section 6.6.3.11</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, after the interaction is over,</p>
<ol>
<li>The Wallet Instance enables the User to report unlawful or
    suspicious requests for personal data by a Relying Party, based on
    information logged by the Wallet Instance. Similarly, the Wallet
    Instance enables the User to request a Relying Party to immediately
    erase personal data obtained from the Wallet Instance. This is
    discussed in <a href="#66312-wallet-instance-enables-the-user-to-report-suspicious-requests-by-a-relying-party-and-to-request-a-relying-party-to-erase-personal-data">Section 6.6.3.12</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="6632-wallet-instance-authenticates-the-relying-party-instance">6.6.3.2 Wallet Instance authenticates the Relying Party Instance</h5>
<p>Relying Party authentication is a process whereby a Relying Party proves
its identity to a Wallet Instance, in the context of an interaction in
which the Relying Party requests the Wallet Instance to present some
attributes. Relying Party authentication is discussed in [Topic 6].</p>
<p>Relying Party authentication is included in the protocol used by a
Wallet Instance and a Relying Party Instance to communicate. As
documented in [Topic 12], at least two different protocols can be used
within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, namely the ones specified in [ISO/IEC
18013-5] and [OpenID4VP]. Both protocols include functionality
allowing the Wallet Instance to authenticate the Relying Party Instance.
Although these protocols differ in the details, on a high level, they
both implement Relying Party authentication as shown in figure 7 below.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 7 High-level sequence diagram for Relying Party Authentication" src="../media/image7.png" /></p>
<!-- <img src="media/image7.png" style="width:4.987771216097988inin;height:4.385083114610674in" /> -->

<p>Figure 7 High-level overview of Relying Party authentication process</p>
<p>The figure shows the following:</p>
<p>First, there are two preconditions that need to be fulfilled before the
Relying Party authentication process can begin. Note that these actions
are not carried out for every presentation, but only once (excluding
possible updates).</p>
<p>A)  The Relying Party registered itself as described in <a href="#632-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-registration-and-notification">Section 6.3.2</a>
    and obtained a Relying Party Instance access certificate.</p>
<p>B)  The Wallet Instance obtained the trust anchor of the Relying Party
    Access Certificate Authority.</p>
<p>Subsequently, during each presentation of attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Relying Party Instance prepares a request for some attributes to
    the Wallet Instance and includes its Relying Party Instance
    certificate in the request, plus all intermediate certificates up to
    (but excluding) the trust anchor.</p>

<p>The Wallet Instance checks the authenticity of the request by

</li>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance checks the authenticity of the Relying Party by
    validating the Relying Party Instance certificate and all
    intermediate certificates included in the request. For validating
    the last intermediate certificate, the Wallet Instance uses the
    trust anchor it obtained from the Trusted List.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance validates that none of the certificates in the
    trust chain have been revoked. This includes the Relying Party
    Instance certificate as well as all other certificates in the trust
    chain, including the trust anchor itself if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Instance continues by requesting the User for approval.</p>
</li>

<p>The User can approve, disapprove or approve selective disclosure of
    the presentation of the requested attributes.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="6633-wallet-instance-evaluates-disclosure-policy-embedded-in-attestation-if-present">6.6.3.3 Wallet Instance evaluates disclosure policy embedded in attestation, if present</h5>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider optionally embeds a disclosure
policy in the PID or attestation. Such an embedded disclosure policy
contains rules determining which (types of) Relying Party are allowed by
the PID Provider or Attestation Provider to receive which attributes
from the PID or attestation.</p>
<p>If a policy is present in the PID or attestation, the Wallet Instance
evaluates the policy, together with data obtained from the Relying Party
or the User, to determine whether the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider allows this Relying Party to receive the requested attributes.
Data obtained from the Relying Party is typically included in the
Relying Party Instance certificate. In any case, the Wallet Instance
authenticates any data obtained from the Relying Party before using it.</p>
<p>The Wallet Instance presents the outcome of the disclosure policy
evaluation to the User in the form of advice, when requesting User
approval. For example, "The issuer of your PID does not want you to
present \&lt;attribute names&gt; to \&lt;Relying Party name&gt;. Do you want to
continue?" Note that the User can overrule the disclosure policy
evaluation outcome.</p>
<p>For more details on the embedded disclosure policy, see [Topic 43].</p>
<h5 id="6634-wallet-instance-obtains-user-approval-for-presenting-attributes">6.6.3.4 Wallet Instance obtains User approval for presenting attributes</h5>
<p>Note: In this document the term 'User approval\' exclusively refers to a
User's decision to present an attribute to a Relying Party. Under no
circumstances User approval to present data from their EUDI Wallet
Instance should be construed as lawful grounds for the processing of
personal data by the Relying Party or any other party. A Relying Party
requesting or processing personal data from an EUDI Wallet Instance must
ensure that it has grounds for lawful processing of that data, according
to Article 6 of the GDPR.</p>
<p>Before presenting any attribute to a Relying Party, the Wallet Instance
requests the User for their approval. This is critical for ensuring that
the User remains in control of their attributes.</p>
<p>A Wallet Instance requests User approval in all use cases, both in
proximity flow and remote flow, and including: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use cases where the Relying Party could be assumed to be trusted,
    for example, when the Relying Party is part of law enforcement or
    another government agency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases where the requested attributes are critical for the
    Relying Party to grant access to the User or deliver the requested
    services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cases where there is, according to the GDPR or other
    legislation, no legal need to ask for the User\'s approval because
    another legal basis exists for requesting the attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A prerequisite for requesting User approval is that the Wallet Instance
is sure that the person using the Wallet Instance is in fact the User.
Therefore, the WSCA authenticates the User prior to or during requesting
User approval, on request of the Wallet Instance. To do so, the Wallet
Instance uses the User authentication mechanisms set up during Wallet
Instance activation, see <a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a>. More detailed requirements
regarding User approval can be found in [Topic 6].</p>
<h5 id="6635-relying-party-instance-verifies-the-authenticity-of-the-pid-or-attestation">6.6.3.5 Relying Party Instance verifies the authenticity of the PID or attestation</h5>
<p>The Relying Party Instance verifies the electronic signature or seal
over the PID or attestation. For PID Providers, QEAA Providers, and
PuB-EAA Providers, the Relying Party Instance uses a trust anchor of the
Provider obtained from a Trusted List. For EAA Providers, the applicable
Rulebook may describe how the Relying Party Instance should obtain the
relevant trust anchor.</p>
<p>The technical implementation of the signature verification process
depends on which of the standards mentioned in [Topic 12] is supported
by the Wallet Instance. Each of these standards specifies in detail how
to carry out electronic signature or seal verification.</p>
<p>In addition, the Relying Party may want to verify that the Attestation
Provider can issue the type of attestation in question. This is only
needed for EAA Providers, as the Relying Party trusts a PID Provider,
QEAA Provider or PuB-EAA Provider by default. For EAA Providers, the
applicable Rulebook may define methods that the Relying Party can use to
verify that the EAA Provider is allowed to issue this type of
attestation.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All PIDs and attestations in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem are digitally signed or sealed by the respective PID Provider or Attestation Provider, or by the WSCD available to the Wallet Instance. If an attestation is digitally signed or sealed by a WSCD, it is called a device-signed or self-issued attestation. Device-signed or self-issued attestations are allowed only if it can be shown that the WSCD signs or seals them at Level of Assurance (LoA) “high”, meaning that the level of security offered by the WSCD is at least equivalent to the security level of the secure infrastructure used by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider for signing or sealing   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signature or seal over the attestation may or may not include the value of the presented attributes. If the attribute values are not included in the signature creation, the Relying Party trusts these attributes because they are presented over an authenticated channel set up between the secure environment (i.e., the WSCD or the secure infrastructure used by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider, see previous bullet) and the Relying Party. One possible way to set up such an authenticated channel is by ensuring the authenticity and integrity (but not the non-repudiation) of the attributes by means of a Message Authentication Code (MAC). The MAC is created by the secure environment over the presented attribute values. The MAC key is generated from an ephemeral key of the Relying Party (sent to the secure environment by the Wallet Instance) in combination with an ephemeral key created by the secure environment. The latter ephemeral key is sent to the Relying Party in such a way that the Relying Party can verify the authenticity of this key. Such a solution, or similar ones, can be used provided that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the solution is fully compliant with the relevant standards, i.e., [ISO/IEC 18013-5] or [OpenID4VP] and [SD-JWT VC].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the solution can be certified for security at LoA "high" according to <a href="#7-security-and-data-protection">chapter 7</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Relying Party typically has a list of attestations that it accepts for
a certain use case. For example, a Relying Party could accept a mobile
Driving Licence (mDL) issued by a national driving licence Provider, as
proof of identity. If a Relying Party decides to accept a specific type
of attestation issued by a specific Attestation Provider, the Relying
Party must accept any valid and authentic attestation issued by that
Attestation Provider, regardless of the User device it is installed
on. In other words, the Relying Party trusts the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider to have verified, during PID or attestation
issuance, that the User device is fit to receive a PID or attestation,
as described in <a href="#6623-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-validates-the-eudi-wallet-instance">Section 6.6.2.3</a>. The Relying Party therefore does not
assess the technical properties of the User device and WSCD during the
attestation presentation process. If the Relying Party were to make its
own independent assessment of the security of the User device, there is
a possibility that it would not accept a User's attestation even though
it is perfectly valid. That would be confusing to Users and might
diminish their trust in their attestations and in the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem as a whole.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="6636-relying-party-verifies-that-the-pid-or-attestation-is-not-revoked">6.6.3.6 Relying Party verifies that the PID or attestation is not revoked</h5>
<p>To allow revocation checking of a PID or attestation, the PID Provider
or Attestation Provider must include revocation information in the PID
or attestation, respectively. This revocation information must include a
URL indicating the location where a Relying Party can obtain a status
list or revocation list, and an identifier or index for this specific
certificate or attestation within that list.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A status list is a bit string or byte string in which each bit or
    group of bits denotes the current revocation status (valid,
    suspended, or revoked) of one attestation. To get the status of the
    attestation it has received from the Wallet Instance, the Relying
    Party obtains the status list from the URL specified in the
    attestation and verifies the value encoded at the bit position given
    by the index value in the attestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A revocation list is a list of PID identifiers or attestations
    identifiers revoked by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider. To
    get the status of the PID or attestation it has received from the
    Wallet Instance, the Relying Party obtains the revocation list from
    the URL specified in the attestation and verifies whether the
    identifier included in the attestation is on the list or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details and requirements, see [Topic 7].</p>
<h5 id="6637-relying-party-verifies-device-binding">6.6.3.7 Relying Party verifies device binding</h5>
<p>Device binding is the property that an attestation is bound to a
specific device (in fact, a WSCD) and cannot be used independent from
that device. Device binding protects the attestation against copying or
cloning, which enhances its security.</p>
<p>A PID Provider or an Attestation Provider implements device binding by
including a cryptographic public key in the attestation and signing it.
The corresponding private key is protected by the certified WSCD used by
the Wallet Instance.</p>
<p>[Topic 9] explains that a WSCD generates a public-private key pair for
each attestation upon request of the Wallet Instance, and that the
Wallet Instance sends the public key to the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider. Furthermore, it discusses how the PID or Attestation Provider
can verify that the corresponding private key is really protected by the
WSCD.</p>
<p>During an interaction, the Relying Party verifies that the PID or
attestation it received from a Wallet Instance is indeed bound to the
WSCD used by the Wallet Instance. The Relying Party does so by
requesting the Wallet Instance to sign some data using the private key
corresponding to the public key in the PID or attestation. For this
reason, device binding is also called 'proof of possession\'. In
[ISO/IEC 18013-5] it is called 'mdoc authentication'. In [SD-JWT VC]
it is called 'key binding'.</p>
<p>The technical implementation of this verification depends on which of
the standards mentioned in [Topic 12] is supported by the Wallet
Instance. Each of these standards specifies in detail how to carry out
this verification.</p>
<h5 id="6638-relying-party-verifies-or-trusts-user-binding">6.6.3.8 Relying Party verifies or trusts User binding</h5>
<p>User binding (sometimes also called 'holder binding') is the property
that the subject of the PID or attestation, meaning the natural or legal
person described in the PID or attestation, is in fact the person that
presents the PID or attestation to the Relying Party. User binding
prevents an attacker from presenting a PID or an attestation that they
are not legally allowed to use.</p>
<p>The mechanism(s) available for User binding depend on the presentation
flow type (proximity or remote, supervised or unsupervised, see also
<a href="#423-mobile-apps-and-web-browsers">Section 4.2.3</a>), and on the attributes issued to the User by the PID
Provider or Attestation Provider.</p>
<p>In the first place, the Relying Party can always decide to trust the
User authentication mechanisms implemented by the Wallet Instance and
the WSCD (see [Topic 9]). This means that the Relying Party trusts
that the Wallet Instance and the WSCD have properly authenticated the
User before allowing the User to present the attributes. Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This trust is not based on the outcome of any verification by the
    Relying Party but is a-priori trust in (in particular) the certified
    WSCD used by the Wallet Instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using this method implies that Relying Parties also trust device
    binding, as described in Section <a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">6.5.3</a>. The Relying Party Instance
    in fact first verifies that the PID or attestation is bound to a
    WSCD trusted by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider, and then
    trusts that the Wallet Instance and the WSCD have properly
    authenticated the User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a matter of fact, this User authentication method will always be
    carried out, since a Wallet Instance must authenticate its User when
    asking for User approval for presenting any attributes, and since
    device binding is also mandatory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in some cases, if a Relying Party does not want to only
trust the above mechanism, it may be able to use User attributes to
carry out User authentication. For example, if the PID or attestation
contains a User portrait, the Relying Party may be able to visually or
biometrically compare that portrait to the face of the person presenting
the attestation or by a photo taken of it (by an automated machine or by
a "selfie"). This will generally be possible in supervised proximity
presentations by human inspection, or in an unsupervised proximity flow
if equipped with the appropriate equipment It may also be possible to do
this in unsupervised presentations by using face recognition technology,
possibly even remotely. However, to generate trustworthy outcomes in
such situations, special conditions are required, such as good lighting,
clear instructions for the User for positioning their face and an
approved liveness detection mechanism supporting Presentation Attacks
Detection (PAD).</p>
<p>Lastly, if the person presenting the PID or attestation is able to
present an identity document, the Relying Party may be able to
authenticate the User by comparing attributes from the PID or
attestation, such as first and last name, to those in the identity
document. However, this requires that the Relying Party can verify that
the identity document really belongs to the person presenting it. In
practice this will often mean that the identity document is a photo ID,
and the presentation must consequently be done in proximity and be
supervised, or done remotely and supported by PAD.</p>
<h5 id="6639-relying-party-verifies-combined-presentation-of-attributes">6.6.3.9 Relying Party verifies combined presentation of attributes</h5>
<p>According to the Regulation, a combined presentation of attributes is a
request for attributes from two or more attestations in the same action.
In this case, the Relying Party has to verify that these attestations
belong to the same User, to prevent a hacked or fraudulent Wallet
Instance from presenting attributes from different Users. [Topic 18]
describes how the Relying Party Instance can verify this by checking
that the public keys in the attestations are associated. Key association
is described in [Topic 9].</p>
<h5 id="66310-relying-party-authenticates-the-wallet-instance-and-the-wallet-provider">6.6.3.10 Relying Party authenticates the Wallet Instance and the Wallet Provider</h5>
<p><a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a> above describes that a Wallet Provider, during activation
of a Wallet Instance, issues a Wallet Instance Attestation (WIA) to the
Wallet Instance. When requesting attributes from a Wallet Instance, a
Relying Party Instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ensures it obtains the WIA from the Wallet Instance. The technical
    way this will be done is yet to be determined, see <a href="#653-wallet-instance-activation">Section 6.5.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verifies the signature over the WIA using the Wallet Provider trust
    anchor obtained from the Wallet Provider Trusted List.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verifies that the Wallet Instance is in possession of the private
    key belonging to the public key in the WIA. This proves that the
    Wallet Instance is authentic and is provided by the trusted Wallet
    Provider.</p>

</ul>
<h5 id="66311-relying-party-verifies-that-wallet-instance-is-not-suspended-or-revoked">6.6.3.11 Relying Party verifies that Wallet Instance is not suspended or revoked</h5>
<p><a href="#6624-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider-verifies-that-wallet-instance-is-not-suspended-or-revoked">Section 6.6.2.4</a> explained how a PID Provider, or an Attestation

The same mechanism is used by Relying Party Instances as well.</p>
<h5 id="66312-wallet-instance-enables-the-user-to-report-suspicious-requests-by-a-relying-party-and-to-request-a-relying-party-to-erase-personal-data">6.6.3.12 Wallet Instance enables the User to report suspicious requests by a Relying Party and to request a Relying Party to erase personal data</h5>
<p>A Wallet Instance will enable the User to report unlawful or suspicious
requests for personal data by a Relying Party to a Data Protection
Authority (DPA). To allow this, a Wallet Instance, perhaps in
combination with the Wallet Provider backend, provides a dashboard
allowing the User to lodge a complaint about a suspicious Relying Party
presentation request to the DPA of the Member State that provided their
EUDI Wallet. For more information and requirements, see [Topic 50].</p>
<p>The dashboard also enables the User to request a Relying Party to
immediately erase personal data. For more information and requirements,
see [Topic 48].</p>
<p>To be able to substantiate a complaint, or to list data that must be
erased, the User needs to be informed about which attributes were
requested by which Relying Parties. To enable this, a Wallet Instance
maintains a log of all attributes that were requested and presented. The
abovementioned dashboard also enables the User to view the log and lodge
a complaint for any attribute in the log. More details about the logging
functionality can be found in [Topic 19].</p>
<h4 id="664-pid-or-attestation-presentation-to-another-wallet-instance">6.6.4 PID or attestation presentation to another Wallet Instance</h4>
<p><a href="#663-pid-or-attestation-presentation-to-relying-party">Section 6.6.3</a> discussed the trust relationships necessary when a Wallet
Instance receives a request from a Relying Party Instance and presents
attributes to that Relying Party Instance.</p>
<p>However, the Regulation requires that a Wallet Instance is also able to
receive such a request from another Wallet Instance, and present
attributes to that requesting Wallet Instance. For more information and
requirements, please refer to [Topic 30].</p>
<h4 id="665-pid-or-attestation-management">6.6.5 PID or attestation management</h4>
<p>Starting from the issuance of a PID or attestation, the PID or
attestation is managed by the User and the Wallet Provider. Management
is performed until the PID, or attestation, is deleted or the Wallet
Instance is de-installed by the User.</p>
<p>For PID and attestation revocation, see [Topic 7]. The User can
request the PID Provider or Attestation Provider to revoke the PID or
attestation at least in case of loss or theft.</p>
<h4 id="666-pid-or-attestation-deletion">6.6.6 PID or attestation deletion</h4>
<p>In case the User no longer wants to retain a specific PID or attestation
in their Wallet Instance, the User can delete it. If the PID Provider or
Attestation Provider issued multiple attestations that have the same
content and are valid, the Wallet Instance deletes them all. Deleting a
PID or an attestation also means that the WSCD destroys the
cryptographic key material associated with that PID or attestation.
Before deleting the PID or attestation and the cryptographic keys, the
(WSCD used by the) Wallet Instance must authenticate the User.</p>

<h3 id="71-introduction">7.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This chapter is dedicated to the certification of EUDI Wallet Solutions,
covering the legal foundation outlined in the amending Regulation (the
Regulation), the overall certification approach, and its accompanying
design principles. In addition, the main two supporting documents, the
High-Level requirements (HLR) and the Risk assessment (RA) are
described. Furthermore, supporting documents regarding certification of
EUDI Wallets are provided in appendix 6 and will be expanded upon in
following releases of the ARF.</p>
<h4 id="711-legal-basis-and-requirements">7.1.1 Legal basis and requirements</h4>
<p>The Regulation requires certification of EUDI Wallets to ensure
conformity of the wallets with functional, security, and privacy related
requirements, to achieve a high level of interoperability, security and
trustworthiness. The use of relevant and available cybersecurity
certification schemes under the Cybersecurity Act (CSA)<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> referenced
in the Regulation implementing act (IA) should avoid divergent
approaches and harmonise the implementation of the cybersecurity
requirements laid down by the Regulation.</p>
<p>Member States, according to Article 5c(3) of the Regulation, shall
designate accredited conformity assessment bodies (CABs) which will
carry out conformity assessment of EUDI Wallets solutions against the
Regulation requirements. Once this designation has been made, Member
States shall communicate to the European Commission the names and
addresses of these public or private bodies under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">Article 5c</a>(7) of the
Regulation.</p>
<p>EUDI Wallet Providers shall request (select, contract) one or more
designated CABs to assess and certify the conformity of their EUDI
Wallet Solution against the requirements of the Regulation.</p>
<p>EUDI Wallet certification is then conducted by the CAB to evaluate and
certify the conformity of the EUDI Wallet Solution (target of the
certification) against requirements which will be established by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1347-1-1">Art. 5a</a>(23) - Implementing act(s) on technical and operational

(EU) 2016/679</a> requirements fully apply to the EUDI Wallets and
consequently to their providers.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">Article 5c</a>(6) specifies that the Commission shall, by means of IA,
establish a list of reference standards and, where necessary, establish
specifications and procedures for the certification of EUDI Wallets.</p>
<p>The certification process of EUDI Wallet Providers should leverage, rely
on, and mandate the use of relevant and existing CSA certification
schemes, or parts thereof, to certify the compliance of wallets or parts
thereof, with the applicable cybersecurity requirements.</p>
<p>For requirements that are not relevant for cybersecurity, and to the
extent that cybersecurity certification schemes do not, or only
partially, cover those cybersecurity requirements, Member States shall
establish national certification schemes following the harmonised
requirements set out in the IA. Member States shall transmit their draft
national certification schemes to the European Digital Identity
Cooperation Group established pursuant to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e4536-1-1">Article 46e</a>(1) (the
'Cooperation Group') which may issue opinions and recommendations.</p>
<p>Certification shall be valid for up to five years, provided that a
vulnerability assessment is carried out every two years. Where a
vulnerability is identified and not remedied in a timely manner,
certification shall be cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="72-overall-approach-to-certification-of-eudi-wallet-solutions">7.2 Overall approach to Certification of EUDI Wallet Solutions</h3>
<p>The certification of EUDI Wallets is of the utmost importance in
ensuring their interoperability, security, trustworthiness, and
robustness. Therefore, the overarching goal is the development of a
dedicated CSA cybersecurity certification scheme. The scope of the
scheme should cover both the EUDI Wallets and the underlying eID scheme.
The Regulation allows the use of national certification schemes only for
those parts that cannot be covered by European cybersecurity
certification schemes and only until such appropriate European
cybersecurity certification schemes are available.</p>
<p>As defining and adopting a dedicated European CSA certification scheme
for EUDI Wallets depends on the complex certification of different
components and requires the full technical specification of the EUDI
Wallets, the certification approach is structured in two phases: a
short-term approach and a long-term approach. In the short-term, the IA
of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">Article 5c</a>(6) will be established, laying the groundwork for the
creation of transitory national certification schemes. Consequently,
building upon the foundation of the IA and transitory schemes, a
dedicated CSA certification scheme for the EUDI Wallets will be
established by ENISA.</p>
<h4 id="721-certification-of-eudi-wallet-solutions-in-the-short-term">7.2.1 Certification of EUDI Wallet Solutions in the short term</h4>
<p>Until a dedicated EUDI Wallets cybersecurity certification scheme under
the CSA is available, the Regulation allows Member States to establish
national certification schemes (following <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">Article 5c</a>(3)). Following
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">Article 5c</a>(6) of the Amending Regulation, an IA should be established
which will serve as a harmonised guideline for the development of these
transitory national certification schemes. It will leverage the use of
relevant and existing CSA certification schemes by establishing
specifications, procedures and reference technical standards for
certification. This can include procedures and methods on how to derive
evaluation activities from an architecture analysis, as well as a
reference certification or a minimum set of risks to be mitigated.</p>
<p>The guiding principles will take into consideration the composite nature
of the EUDI Wallets, as well as the potential different architectures
considering that the amending Regulation is technology and architecture
neutral. Guidance on certification will allow for various proposed
architecture models (including components, security functions, threats,
mitigations), evaluation of their individual components (design,
implementation, and effectiveness), and related risks as reflected
through a common risk registry defined by the RA (see also <a href="#74-risk-based-approach-and-risk-registry">Section 7.4</a>).</p>
<p>The IA will refer to standards, and where available, relevant European
CSA schemes must be used. Currently, only the EUCC scheme for the
cybersecurity certification of the ICT products, parts, or components
for products<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> is available. For those cybersecurity requirements not
covered by the EUCC, its supporting documents or an extended version of
the EUCC, and for the non-cybersecurity requirements, the use of the
ISO/IEC 17065<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> framework under Regulation (EC) 765/2008<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> is
foreseen as the harmonised standard for certification. This may be
complemented by ISO/IEC 17067<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> on the definition of schemes, which is
like ENISA's previous work in the definition of other candidate EU
certification schemes.</p>
<p>In order to prepare the content on the IA, the transitory national
certification schemes, and eventually a dedicated cybersecurity
certification scheme under the CSA, the following key documents are
prepared; a Risk and Cybersecurity Assessment, a HLR, and a mapping of
relevant existing certification schemes (the latter two documents
prepared by ENISA). In addition, an architecture survey has been
conducted in the Toolbox Expert Group to gain insights into potential
EUDI Wallet implementations and architectural possibilities.</p>
<p>First, the RA aims to identify initial security and privacy threats
(potential attacks carried out by different actors) and provide a list
of assets which must be protected against the identified threats
(critical, non-critical). The risks will provide input to a common risk
registry, listing the minimum set of risks that should be addressed by
Member States' implementations (see also <a href="#74-risk-based-approach-and-risk-registry">Section 7.4</a>). This common risk registry will serve as input to the
IA, and later on to the detailed definition of privacy and security
requirements to mitigate identified threats, at the relevant Level of
Assurance.</p>
<p>Second, the HLR document provides recommendations for the certification
of EUDI Wallet implementations in the short term. It outlines the
high-level process requirements for certification, in addition to
high-level statements on the functional components of the EUDI Wallet.
In essence, it defines 'what' will need to be certified and what the
process steps will be. The identified requirements in this document form
the skeleton of the IA [appendix 6]).</p>
<p>Third, a mapping of existing certification schemes is performed to
support the requirements of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32024R1183#d1e1875-1-1">Article 5c</a>(2) of the Regulation, mandating
the use of relevant and existing European cybersecurity certification
schemes. This mapping can include European, national, and other global
schemes, in relation to the defined certification requirements (i.e.,
functional, process, privacy and security certification requirements).</p>
<p>Fourth, once the mapping has been performed, it will be used as a basis
for the development of certification schemes for EUDI Wallets, both at
the national and European levels. The schemes will rely on the
identified certification schemes to provide assurance, either in a
composite approach, or through the establishment of assumptions on
external components, such as the Wallet users' devices.</p>
<p>Finally, non-cybersecurity requirements should ensure functional
interoperability of the EUDI Wallet. To this end, the IA aims to define
a requirement to CABs for functional testing, for example supported by
test-suites or test cases.</p>
<h4 id="722-certification-of-eudi-wallet-solutions-in-the-long-term">7.2.2 Certification of EUDI Wallet Solutions in the long term</h4>
<p>In parallel to the work described above, ENISA is requested to draft a
dedicated European cybersecurity certification scheme for the EUDI
Wallets under the CSA. Once available, this CSA scheme should replace
the national transitory schemes mentioned above for the cybersecurity
requirement it will cover. This scheme should be based on harmonised
requirements, and identify any additional requirements relevant for
cybersecurity. The scheme should further detail the cybersecurity
requirements, identify and set normative standards and define the target
level of assurance or security for the relevant EUDI Wallet components.</p>
<p>The scheme should also take into account the inputs of the ARF as part
of the Toolbox process, and the input from the Certification subgroup
(CSG), including deliverables mentioned above.</p>
<p>Finally, ENISA is asked to also facilitate the transition from national
certification schemes to the dedicated cybersecurity certification
scheme under the CSA.</p>
<p>A visual description of the overall EUDI Wallet certification process
can be found in [<a href="../annexes/annex-6/annex-6-certification-requirements.pdf">annex 6</a>].</p>
<h3 id="73-high-level-requirements-hlr">7.3 High-Level Requirements (HLR)</h3>
<p>The main goal of the HLR document is to provide recommendations for the
certification of EUDI Wallets implementations in the short term. It
outlines the high-level process requirements for certification. It also
provides functional and process-related requirements derived from the
Regulation, to facilitate certification.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process-related:</strong> Related to the 'how' rather than the 'what' of
    certification, such as process to define or obtain a certification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional:</strong> Describes functional requirements (i.e. what the
    EUDI Wallet should be able to do, such as provisioning of
    attributes). Most functional requirements are derived in the other
    sections of the ARF coming from the Toolbox process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide recommendations on certification, the document describes 121
requirements across five sections: legal requirements, scheme
requirements, general scheme content, other scheme content and
annexes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> Describes the certification requirements,
    certification scope stemming from the Regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheme requirements:</strong> Describes the EUDI Wallets, how to organise
    certification, and the content of a scheme and the accompanying IA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General scheme content:</strong> Describes HLR related to content of the
    scheme, such as accreditation, non-conformities, vulnerability
    management, and peer assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other scheme content:</strong> Describes supporting requirements, such as
    licensing, surveillance, marketing, review and Wallet versioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annexes:</strong> Describes methods and procedures, dependency analysis,
    acceptance criteria for assurance information and surveillance and
    compliance monitoring.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="74-risk-based-approach-and-risk-registry">7.4 Risk-based approach and risk registry</h3>
<h4 id="741-introduction">7.4.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>This chapter details the approach to develop harmonised guidelines for
the development of the transitory national certification schemes. In
addition to the process-based requirements in the HLR, security and
privacy risks associated with the EUDI Wallets should be identified.
Here, a risk-based approach is envisioned as the basis for certification
by Member States. This is inspired by known processes such as for the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and related Data Protection
Impact Assessments (DPIA).</p>
<p>The risk-based approach proposes that a common risk register will be
developed that contains a comprehensive but non-exhaustive list of
security and privacy risks. These risks are architecture-agnostic and
provide a benchmark overview of the most critical risks. As a minimum,
Member States schemes should require Wallet Providers to evaluate these
risks and propose appropriate mitigations in a dedicated risk assessment
that will be evaluated by CABs. The methodology to perform the
individual RA will be up to the Member States, as long as it
demonstrates taking into account the risks identified in the common risk
register.</p>
<p>This chapter will define, through iterative publications of the ARF, the
rationale and approach to derive and categorise these identified risks
and provide the iterative output of this exercise as a starting point of
relevant privacy and security risks.</p>
<h4 id="742-rationale-and-approach">7.4.2 Rationale and approach</h4>
<p>Threats and risks play pivotal roles in the EUDI Wallets certification
process as they are fundamental in achieving the security objectives
described in the Regulation, such as privacy, confidentiality,
integrity, availability, authenticity and non-repudiation of the EUDI
Wallet and the data contained in it. Importantly, understanding the
threats and risks in relation to the separate assets involved allows to
determine the mitigation (and related certification requirements or
standards).</p>
<p>A simplified overview of this approach is shown below. In short, threats
may cause risks to assets. These assets are the components and elements
listed in the reference architecture, including the Wallet Secure
Cryptographic Application (WSCA) and Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device
(WSCD).</p>
<p>Threats can be defined according to different threat models, such as the
STRIDE approach for security threat risks, and the LINDDUN framework for
privacy threat modelling. Such models allow to inspire and categorise
threats such as spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, or linking.
While security and privacy are closely related, they do start from a
different mindset. Both security threat modelling and privacy threat
modelling aim to create a system model, identify threats systematically
for each system component and rely on threat categories to drive the
analysis. This helps to eventually mitigate threats, for example through
certification requirements. However, the security mindset is to protect
assets, whereas the privacy mindset is to protect personal data of the
user.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 8: Relation between threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and assets" src="../media/image8.png" /></p>
<!-- <img src="media/image8.png" style="width:3.920138888888889in;height:1.7666666666666666in" /> -->

<p>Figure 8: Relation between threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and assets</p>
<p>A threat modelling approach will support deriving privacy and security
risks and gain insights into potential risks within the system. The
outcome of the threat model exercise will be a list of security and
privacy risks, which in turn allows to identify the appropriate
treatment, such as mitigation or acceptance. A common, minimum set of
risks will form the foundation for the risk registry, which will be used
by Member States as a benchmark to assess the security of their national
transitory certification schemes.</p>
<h3 id="75-design-principles-and-assumptions">7.5 Design principles and assumptions</h3>
<p>In the approach to EUDI Wallet certification described above, a few
design principles can be identified and will be further expanded upon
through work in the CSG:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amending Regulation requires the EUDI Wallets to be certified at
    LoA 'high'. However, not all EUDI Wallet components may need to
    individually meet LoA 'high' or be certified, for the overall EUDI
    Wallet to reach that level of assurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transitory schemes are defined by the Member States which may
    tailor them to their specific Wallet architectures. However, the aim
    is to harmonise the underlying principles through the IA and provide
    guidance or common requirements where relevant as no mutual
    recognition of the national certification schemes is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certification scheme will be a composite scheme. The object
    certification will be the entire system (eID scheme, EUDI Wallet,
    management thereof). It will therefore have to align with and rely
    on other available international standards, certification schemes,
    and conformity assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification should cover both cross-functional requirements,
    including security and privacy, as well as functional requirements
    in order to ensure European interoperability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final EUDI Wallet certification implies a multitude of
    certificates, however, the aim is to minimise this number to the
    extent possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certification scheme should support a variety of different known
    and unknown architectures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
